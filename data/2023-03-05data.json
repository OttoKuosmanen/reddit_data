I want him out of our lives, what can I do?\nThis account was made as a throwaway three or four months ago, when I feared my son was trying to hurt my family. He proceeded to set the house on fire with his sister, my sister and two family dogs in it. He has been an escalating issue for several years (I will post my old draft below in comment) and at this point he went to stay with his dad while my family, now homeless, took emergency shelter at a hotel. Because of the arson, a social worker came to my daughter at school to check on her safety at home. General bases to cover like access to food and clothing, and if she was harmed in any way. They met with me after this, to let me know that my daughter has been sexually abused by my son. She is 6 and he is 13. I broke down hearing what the worker quoted to me and I still am. My poor daughter had never told me. From the time I guess this may have happened (from context of the social worker\u2019s retelling; I don\u2019t want to pressure her or ask questions), I can deduce she may have been as little as 3 or 4.

I don\u2019t suspect he has been abused but to him, no casualty is too great to spare in order to get what he wants. Everything is a means to an end.

He kept pushing himself on me and picked me up putting on the sick. I told him NO! and I'm serious and started pushing at him but he just grabbed my hands and kept saying I do want it. I started crying at that point begging him not to rape me and that's when he stopped.  I was crying and he left me there. I pulled my pants back up and today recieved a text saying he's sorry if he scared me... But I feel odd that I had a boner when I did not want to have sex with him.

Then I saw her at the gym.\nI work at an after school tutoring academy. The management has been really awful and we have a high staff turnover. Up until recently we were not allowed any days off and if we were sick we were still expected to work as we could \u201cjust sit in the classroom and tell the children what to do\u201d. This kind of approach lead to 3 teachers leaving at once, resulting in me having to cover many new classes or even have 2 year levels in a class at once (which is difficult when they\u2019re on completely different curriculum/topics and need individual attention). \nA few weeks ago we hired more teachers so we could all have a lighter work load and be covered if someone was sick or needed a day off. The manager was the first one to take advantage of this and took a day off for a family birthday. So I also put in a request to have a day off as my partner is a professional athlete and will be playing in a very important final next week. I got the day approved and I worked out travel and accommodation for the match. That is until today, when she texted me to say that I can\u2019t have the day off anymore because she injured her foot  (a small cut with a couple of stitches) and is now on 2 weeks of sick leave, meaning I have to cover her classes. I didn\u2019t reply because I was extremely frustrated and didn\u2019t know how to respond so I went to the gym to blow off some steam.
