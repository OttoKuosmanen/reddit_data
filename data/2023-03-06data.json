I want him out of our lives, what can I do?\nThis account was made as a throwaway three or four months ago, when I feared my son was trying to hurt my family. He proceeded to set the house on fire with his sister, my sister and two family dogs in it. He has been an escalating issue for several years (I will post my old draft below in comment) and at this point he went to stay with his dad while my family, now homeless, took emergency shelter at a hotel. Because of the arson, a social worker came to my daughter at school to check on her safety at home. General bases to cover like access to food and clothing, and if she was harmed in any way. They met with me after this, to let me know that my daughter has been sexually abused by my son. She is 6 and he is 13. I broke down hearing what the worker quoted to me and I still am. My poor daughter had never told me. From the time I guess this may have happened (from context of the social worker\u2019s retelling; I don\u2019t want to pressure her or ask questions), I can deduce she may have been as little as 3 or 4.

There is a reason this worries me. Ideally, they find him, and he gets arrested or sent to a facility. If he is given benefit, he will do or say anything to get what he wants. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do or say but I know nothing is off limits. The worker mentioned they\u2019d want to know if he was perpetuating abuse he was a victim of, so I have already prepared for the possibility that he accuses any family member, my boyfriend (my boyfriend has never been alone with either of them regardless of the fact that I trust him) or even myself of having abused him. I don\u2019t suspect he has been abused but to him, no casualty is too great to spare in order to get what he wants. Everything is a means to an end. We have endured suicide threats (that we took seriously), physical violence, running away, vandalism and now arson/attempted murder because he didn\u2019t get his way. \n\nI know I\u2019m supposed to still love him. I don\u2019t think I do. For the last year the house felt so tense when he was there. We were always on eggshells. Being away from him we feel like we finally have peace (with the exception of this news and him being involved in our lives again). All I want is to be done with him. I want to move forward with my daughter and never have him able to come near us or the possibility of him entering our lives. I know, big picture he needs to be away from people, guns and the internet and into serious therapy. Right now, I just want him out of our lives.

I honestly dont even know where to start but I've been diagnosed w more than 30 mental illnesses. even though some of them aren't technically official like schizophrenia bc of the fact that u cant actually get diagnosed w certain things till your 18 they just basically label it as onset schizoaffective disorder or whatever it is they just say its onset bc they basically know I have it but cant diagnose it officially.

I've been smoking since i was about 12 and drinking since a year before that. I've taken long breaks from smoking and drinking to see if it makes anything better but it never does even after months of not smoking or drinking. i have really bad trauma because growing up a lot of my friends ended up dying some of them right in front of me. one of their birthdays was today. I try to talk to people about it sometimes but most of the time they just dont listen or dont take it seriously. I was in a rly bad abusive relationship about 2 years ago but no one took it seriously because I'm a guy and no one believed me. all of this is just locked up in my head all day because no one knows about it. no one ever asks and if they did they wouldn't care. I have friends but they always lie to me. I know most of them r using me. I've gone to therapy counseling psychologists psychiatrists everything and nothing helps no matter what i say or do. I'm on 13 different medications right now most of which I'm taking double all the way up to 8x regular doses of. my parents dont rly care ab me and they never have. one time I disappeared for 3 weeks and they barely even noticed. didnt do anything no police report didnt even wonder where I was. they never rly talked to me or interacted w me at all as a child.

I honestly dont rly have any reason to stay in this town anymore. for months I've been thinking ab just disappearing one day and not coming back.

I have a 9 month old son and my ex has gone no contact and disappeared. My only friends think I'm gross for having sex and a baby before marriage. I'm not even Christian anymore. The only people who want to talk to me are creepy dudes who want a one night stand or want to get with a vulnerable woman to harm me more. I like white guys, I need to point that out, but most of them are rude and give me unsolicited opinions about how they'd never date a black woman or how I should have used protection and they wouldn't raise a black man's baby when I didn't ask them to. I'm just looking for friends and get that BS the moment I they find out. My mom hates me and her solution is to find another man. I work overnights so my parents can babysit and my coworkers hate me too. The nicest ones don't even speak English.\n\nI live in Mankato, Minnesota. Not many black people here, and the ones that are here are mostly from Somalia, a Muslim country, and most of them don't speak much English. I met some Somalian people a few years ago, but a lady I used to talk to a lot now says I should get back with my abusive ex because raising a baby without him goes against God, and I'm gross for not being married before sex. That's probably most of their culture's opinions. I'm so tired of religion being used against me and racist white people making me feel like dirt. I should move, but I don't know where I can go where I'd be welcome. I'm not trying to get with another man. I just want friends so I don't go insane.

He kept pushing himself on me and picked me up putting on the sick. I told him NO! and I'm serious and started pushing at him but he just grabbed my hands and kept saying I do want it.
