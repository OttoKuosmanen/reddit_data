            "Question": "Is it normal to be attracted to masculine women?\nGuys I don't know if this is normal. I'm definitely a straight male. I have no attraction whatsoever to men. But women who are somewhat muscular and have short hair really seem attractive to me for some reason. Even better if I feel like they might stand up for me or protect me.\n\nWhat does this mean? Does this make me less of a man?",

I\u2019m scared to tell my parents.\nI was watching two of my non-verbal autistic siblings like I do everyday and everything was fine until I went in my room for a bit to go on my computer . I have my computer to where I can see my door in case my sister walks out her room. I do this because she steals everything and either rips it or puts it in her mouth so she has to be monitored 24/7\n\nI guess I didn\u2019t see her take my men\u2019s multivitamin case but when I checked on her later there she was eating two of them. I had her spit it out and I took the case and quickly counted how many were left. In total there\u2019s 150 gummies, I had taken 10 so far and when I counted there was 76 left meaning she supposedly ate 64 gummies because I couldn\u2019t find any in the room, Your suppose to take 2 a day. \n\nI don\u2019t understand how she opened it because it\u2019s child locked but she did and I\u2019m freaking out because my parents will kill me if I tell them. She\u2019s overweight and the multivitamins are for men but she seems fine and normal, it\u2019s been an hour already. I don\u2019t know if I should tell them because everything seems fine. What do I do?\n\nUPDATE: I called poison control and they said she should be fine since their gummies but to just give her lots of water.",

            "Question": "Confused about my sexuality and in the process of losing the one person I was ever comfortable with.\nI'm having trouble finding a subreddit this fits in, but am desperate to send it off somewhere!  It just mysteriously never showed up on the other ones I've tried, so I wonder if the mods just quietly deleted it, or never let it through.  I hope this is okay to post here.\n\nI don\u2019t know what I hope to get out of this post.  Maybe advice, or information that seems relevant to any of it, or just your own stories if you\u2019ve been through anything like this or find any of my problems relatable.  I want to know it isn\u2019t just me. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, and I don\u2019t know how to organize it all, so here we go! It\u2019s going to be incredibly hard to follow, and I\u2019m sorry for that.\n\n---\n\nI seem to be broken.  The hardware is all there, but the software was never installed,  Maybe the software is in there, but too buggy to work.  I don\u2019t know.  All I know is I\u2019m 25 and have never had sex, and don\u2019t really have desire to.  I mean\u2026 I want to try, now, sort of, but haven\u2019t always.  I want someone to appreciate my body.  I wish I had let someone appreciate it when it was younger and stronger and tighter.  I age, and lose my opportunity to explore, to be desired.  I am not religious; it is not that Catholic Shame that prevents me from sex.  It just horrifies and disgusts me.  I evolved for multiplying, and the sex that is a necessity for it.  Sexuality is a big part of being a mammal, of being a human.  Why why why do I lack it?  I can enjoy looking at a man, generally don\u2019t enjoy looking at women the same way, and tend to be more comfortable when the view excludes the genitals.\n\nMy external sex organs feel uncomfortable and creep me out a bit, but not as bad as they used to.  I have not been a victim of sexual abuse.  I am not transgender.  I feel like a woman, and would be unhappy with a penis.  (Any ideas what could be up with me here?)  Physically and mentally, I am a woman; however recently I have come to wonder if it is possible to be psychologically one gender but *socially* the other, if that makes sense.  The way a man treats a male friend is very different than a woman treats a woman, a woman treats a man, or a man treats a woman.  There is a specific kind of friendship and interaction I have only ever observed between men, and it saddens me that it is unlikely I will ever fully experience that type of bond.\n\nBesides this lack of sex drive and such, I am not much of a people person.  I have my one good friend, and that was all I needed, but I\u2019m losing him through no intention of either of us.  I have made a few work friends, even having gone to parties with some and out to a restaurant for drinks with another, but find it hard to be with people.\n\n---\n\nWe were originally \u201cpen-pals\u201d (keyboard pals).  I was in university and heavily struggling.  It turns out I had some wild anemia that should have left me completely incapable (but somehow didn\u2019t quite) and some fucky hormones that were making it hard to function, but I didn\u2019t get those answers when I needed them.  I felt very overwhelmed and alone, ended up on a penpal-finding site, and he messaged me.  At first, I was annoyed by his comment that he, too, knew how it felt, to feel like one was getting left behind in a world that was moving on too fast, but kept that thought to myself and kept the conversation going.  Turns out, he really did know, better than I.\n\nWe became great friends.  We could tell each other anything.  I learned he was ill, lost most his friends because of it (when he couldn\u2019t party, the partiers left; when he couldn\u2019t work, those relationships dissolved; when he couldn\u2019t play cricket, his teammates were no longer teammates).  He left home at 17 to escape an abusive alcoholic father, worked so hard on his education, got his degree, and I imagine life was finally becoming okay.  He only got to work a few years at the career he fought for before he became ill, and eventually couldn\u2019t physically perform regardless of how hard he pushed.  He and I found each other and became pen-pals a few years later, at which point he was mobile within his home and usually managed to get outside a little bit once every few days.\n\nHe was (is?) fun and upbeat, charismatic, witty.  I was surprised to eventually learn that he had gone through some sexual and emotional abuse/trauma that left him with body dysmorphia, feeling worthless and unlovable, on-and-off suicidal with several botched attempts.  Even before this came out, we were very close, and it made me more comfortable with being open about my own struggles with the idea of sex.  Our problems here were very different, but somehow also very much the same.\n\nYears of phone calls and photos and daily text-chats went by.  He\u2019d often express his regret that I wasn\u2019t from somewhere closer (\u201cshame you\u2019re not local\u201d); we\u2019d talk about how nice it would be if I could just pop in for a cup of tea and a visit, sometimes.  We\u2019d discussed the possibility of me coming to meet him, someday.  Perhaps that amount of long-distance communication is odd and unhealthy.  What do you think?  Can someone really be friends with a person they\u2019ve never met?  Were we too co-dependent?  \n\nAnyway\u2026 a couple years went by, and I ended up going traveling through a few countries that were close together.  At the last country, I ended up on his doorstep.  He didn\u2019t know I was coming, and I had found a few accommodations (hostels and campgrounds) nearby that I\u2019d intended to check out and check into one of once I arrived.  I thought he\u2019d probably chat with me on his doorstep, and if things went well I would come back and spend more time with him other days.  To my surprise, this beautiful, generous, vulnerable human who had no idea I was coming *trusted* me, opened up his little home to me, and made it clear that I was welcome to anything in it.  Though he is just renting one room in the house, I ended up there at a point where 3 others had just left and a fourth was in the process of moving out and no longer lived there, so we had privacy and the run of the house.\n\nWe watched movies together and played a board game he ordered.  We sat around and drank tea and listened to music and chatted and were our odd selves.  I had recently joined a cricket team in my home country, and he helped me practice his sport a bit outside.  He wanted to make sure I explored and did some touristy things, and would find me maps and send me off on adventures he couldn\u2019t follow on.  As I walked out the door, he\u2019d be grabbing me my the backpack to stuff in snacks and juice and the like.  He told me what foods I should try and where to get them, and once when I got home from a hike, I found he had made me a big pot of pasta.  I know that took a good bit of effort with his limited energy.  I felt so cared about.  I loved so well, and was so well-loved.  But, of course, I had to go back to my own country.  Those were a happy 10 days that I\u2019ve been chasing ever since.\n\nWe continued chatting via text and phone call, sharing photos and videos.  A few months later, we planned for me to return the next summer.  We thought I might get a YM Visa down the road, so I could live and work out there for a couple years, but I\u2019m getting older and trying to start a career, and am only eligible for that visa until I am 30, and I can\u2019t see this being a possibility in the next few years, so I guess that\u2019s that, then.  Yet another thing the pandemic ripped from me.\n\n After I left that first time, I kept becoming even fonder of him.  I loved him; I knew that for a long time.  He felt like a cool older brother, sort of, and I loved him that way.  But also I was discovering it was a versatile kind of love.  I *could* love him like a sibling.  I could love him as if he were my son, and I were ferociously maternally protective.  I could love him as a friend.  I felt a sort of attraction I\u2019d never felt, before, too.  I could love him romantically, if I so chose.  So I did, and once I spilled my guts out to him, he eventually came around to the idea as well.  I didn\u2019t push him; he just grew into the idea on his own.  We we became even closer, in this strange new way.  Eventually, I felt willing \u2013\u2013 excited, even \u2013\u2013 to try to explore some physical intimacy and sexuality with him.\n\nThe pandemic started getting attention a couple weeks before my flight would have left, and he urged me to cancel my ticket and try again when it was sorted out and safer in a few weeks.  Boy, if we knew then what we know now\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been 4 years since I\u2019ve seen him.  He\u2019s gotten gradually sicker the whole time, which was somewhat expected.  Most days he\u2019s not really well enough to chat back-and-forth, but will still text me to let me know he\u2019s okay.  On lucid/focused/better (never \u201cgood\u201d) days we chat and I see his old self peek out from time to time.  He is vaccinated, but caught COVID a while back, which also did not help things. I thought that post-covid would be a good time to slip in a visit, during the window which he had the antibodies from fighting off the infection and would be protected by both the vaccine and natural immunity.  He said he was too sick to visit (I think he\u2019s self-conscious about his situation; things must be unravelling over there) and too scared, and I watched that little window where I could visit without putting him in danger slowly close.\n\nI know I won\u2019t see him again, now.  I\u2019ve tried to come to terms with that for the last few years, but keep finding myself picking up scraps of hope.  I wish I could move on.  I\u2019ve tried.  I have a hard time finding people I can make connections with, and he was one of the precious few.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever experience a romantic connection again.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever feel ready to explore intimacy again.  I don\u2019t want to die a virgin, but I can\u2019t bring myself to even consider touching anyone else, yet.  Maybe the right person will come along, and be patient enough to stand by me for years as a friend, until I feel safe and secure and emotionally connected/intimate enough to try.\n\nI just can\u2019t stop thinking of all those little pockets of happiness we\u2019ve had, and all the happiness I never got the chance to have.  I imagined getting home from work and crawling into bed behind him, or making dinner while he kept me company.  I thought about the movies and music I wanted to share with him, all the cups of tea I wanted to drink with him.  I think about wanting to wake up to that bright face and its absurdly mobile eyebrows (he emotes with these in the most adorable, exaggerated way, lol), that beautifully rough voice and its prickly accent.  I never met his mum, but we sort-of interacted, and we somewhat communicated through him.  Early on, when we were just starting to get close as keyboard-pals, I guess he told his mum and sister about me.  They asked about me a few times over the year, and supposedly expressed fondness.  I\u2019ve asked about them some, too, and get the impression that I would get along with his little family very well.  As creepy as I\u2019m sure this is, I looked forward to meeting them, and am sad I will not.  I always thought I\u2019d bring his Mum a little pot of zinnias to first meet her, and we\u2019d probably end up drinking tea and talking about bits and bobs and\u2026\n\nanyway, I\u2019m rambling.  It\u2019s just a weird thing.  I always knew this relationship was a long shot and could never actually last, but I wanted to steal a few more happy moments in this life, and thought I could help supply some better moments to him, too, and it\u2019s hard watching that opportunity become an impossibility and not knowing whether I will ever feel such a connection again, or if I even want to feel such a connection with someone else.  I know this whole thing has been absolutely absurd from the beginning, but kind of wonderful, too.\n\n---\n\nWas this relationship always unhealthy?  Was it weird?  How do I get over it?  How do I move on?\n\nAny idea what's up with my sexuality?  What can I do about that?  I don't want my broken sexuality.  I want to be able to explore.\n\nWhat about my thought of being \"socially male\"?  Any idea what that might be?  Is there a term for it?",

Never cleaned, etc, and was never forced to pick up or have a daily routine. I recently got on new meds to help w depression and to overall motivate me to live a better life while I do counseling and other things. Dad and I both are severely mentally ill, but he has never got treatment. He is retired now, but does nothing all day. The state of our house is completely unlivable at this point, mold to where one room is completely closed off and I can\u2019t breathe (I have asthma and severe allergies), it is also just filled with trash bags, etc. We have carpets in every room but kitchen and bathroom, all of which are completely destroyed, so much clutter to where it\u2019s unbearable and there is no living space (house is only 800 sqft). Dad sleeps on the nastiest couch with the dogs (we adopted before mom passed). I want to completely tear down the house and build a new one.

I\u2019ll call him \u201cL\u201d for this story. \n\nWhen I found out I was pregnant I knew immediately that I would be going through with the pregnancy and keeping my baby.  I had decided to tell L pretty quickly. I didn\u2019t think he would react the way he did. After telling him, he immediately asked what I was planning on doing. I told him I wanted to keep the baby. He got kinda angry and told me it\u2019s unfair for me to make that decision. He told me he\u2019s not ready for nor wants a child right now. I had tried explaining my feelings on ab**tion, and why I made the decision I did. L didn\u2019t want to hear my reasoning or talk about it whatsoever. He had told me I was being selfish. \n\nI completely believe the father should be able to have some opinion on these things. But on the other hand, it\u2019s also my body and half my child as well. I feel terrible over the way things went with L. He now refuses to talk to me and I\u2019m not sure what to do now. I know I want to keep my baby. \n\nWith all that being said, I\u2019m hoping to get some outside opinions on this. Am I being selfish? Has anyone else been through this? Thanks in advance!",

            "Question": "My (50F) son (15M) has become a far-right extremist and I have no idea what to do\n \n\nThrowaway account because this is too embarrassing.\n\nFor some context, my son is on the spectrum and has difficulty forming relationships with people as a result, although he still has a few in person friends. He's extremely intelligent, and knows many things, especially when he puts his mind to it. I also know he uses a lot of social media, since it's easier for him to make friends that way, however I did not monitor them which I regret doing.\n\nThe first red flag was when he was 13 and he began talking to me about various statistics which he said proved that the races were not equal, like crime and IQ, and when I pointed out there are societal reasons for this, he went on a rant and said that that these are actually biological (I still don't know what his sources are). At that time I just chalked it up to him not understanding the world very well and assumed he would grow out of it, but it has only gotten worse in every way.\n\nHe ordered a copy of Mein Kampf to our home. Fortunately, I saw the package and threw it away before he could get his hands on it, but when I confronted him about it, he started screaming and telling me that all his online friends and he started a reading group where they would read books together and they started with Mein Kampf, and that now he would be left out. I asked him if any of his friends at school were reading Mein Kampf, and he said that they were \"normies\" who didn't understand reality. I asked him if he thought I was a \"normie\" too, and he went on an incredibly misogynistic tirade against me saying that I was a \"whore\" and a \"roastie\" (I looked up what it meant later and I was horrified) for pursuing my career (which has provided our family with lots of money, including that he benefits from!) and for openly talking about my past relationships before I met his father, and also because his father and were never married and now separated. He told me he hated me for ruining his life by waiting \"so long\" to have children which is why he was on the spectrum and had difficulty talking to people (many of my friends had children at my age and they did not have children on the spectrum, not that it's a problem anyway). And that was only the beginning, I do not wish to go into more detail, but I couldn't even say anything to him as I broke down crying. I loved my son and we were so close until that point and never before had anything so mean ever been said to me. I couldn't handle it. I didn't understand why he would say such horrible things to me, or how he could have learned such ideas. I am a progressive, and especially feminist, and I thought I was raising our son to hold the same values, but he became the complete opposite of what I wanted him to be.\n\nIn the aftermath of this, I confiscated his computer and phone, although I did let him send one last message to his horrible \"friends\" since he wouldn't stop screaming to us about how he couldn't just abandon them without saying anything. However, this did not help in any way. He began spending more and more time outside the house, which I thought was a good thing and that maybe he was socializing with his peers who didn't accept this sort of thing. I also noticed over the next few months that he was getting more and more muscular, I was proud of him, but I also did not want him to believe he had to prove his \"manliness\" by getting big muscles, he then cursed me out and told me I was trying to make him a \"soyboy\" (a term I did not know and had to look up) so he didn't care what I had to say. Eventually I find out he somehow managed to find a skinhead gang after school and they workout together... after I saw him with them, I screamed at him and then at them that they as grown men should stop trying to manipulate a teenage boy and there was no reason for him to spend time with strange men in their 20s and 30s.\n\nAfter that, I was very strict about everything he was doing. I would pick him up and drop him off, even though it meant I needed to take off time from work to do so. When I dropped him off at home, I locked the doors to make sure he could not escape before returning to work. However, this did not work either, and eventually I was called by the school principle who let us know that he and his school friends (who he has also convinced to become Nazis now!) had beaten a group of POC boys up and that he and his friends would receive a suspension as a result. I was so livid. I could not imagine the fact I was raising a future criminal, and he told me that I was a traitor for not being proud of him for being stronger than them and for beating up \"murderers of our people, rapists of our women, and invaders of our lands\". No reason can get to him, and no discipline can get to him. And now I AM SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES TOO, all my friends now assume I must be a racist because of my son, and don't want to spend time with me anymore. The other parents at the school avoid me. People who used to be friendly are now cold. I have no idea how to deal with this situation, can anyone here on Reddit give me good advice?",

Because of our family size we prefer to get an Airbnb and while we\u2019re visiting we will also take our kids to do some touristy thing. Well my younger sister, Layla was  also invited and suggested we get a place to share so that her kids can hang out with mine and we could save a bit of money by splitting cost.. In most circumstances/ with most people ( or Layla solo) I wouldn\u2019t mind but I really do not want to spend any amount of nights with her kids.. I love them. I truly do. I just can\u2019t handle how naughty they are.. The younger one isn\u2019t that bad but the older child, Keith (8),who I suspect is neurodivergent, does not listen, he is very rude, has little to no manners, and is mischievous in scary ways. Part of me wants to support her because she\u2019s a single mom but the other part of me doesn\u2019t want to ruin this time away from me, my husband or kids.. Because of the last trip we took together where Keith was caught stealing, set a garbage can on fire, and wouldn\u2019t listen to Layla at all; My husband was a firm no. so, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do but I don\u2019t know how to tell my sister without this coming off really bad.. She is super sensitive and always feels like the world is out to get her and her kids. They literally do no wrong in her eyes until it\u2019s really bad.

I just told her we plan staying with a friends one night ( which is true) and that I think it would be best for all of us to have separate spaces to unwind since our kids will all be a bit more cranky from traveling.. I also said it would probably be best so none of us have to deal with each others kids different sleeping patterns and such.. \nI appreciate the input. It helped me find a way to be kind and direct about my families needs. The only think I didn\u2019t do was write it in a away that was absolutely firm so if she come back with a \u201c oh I don\u2019t mind\u201d I\u2019ll have to add a bit of spice to make sure she understands it\u2019s nonnegotiable.

Not only do you have to put yourself out there, some people won't always like you or want to talk to you.   That's life.   Its also difficult if nobody is up there.  If no one is there, I have just one or two and chat with the bartender (all of whom I know.)   This is more difficult in packed clubs with a hundred people.\n\nEvery serious relationship I've ever had happened when I wasn't \"trying\" to meet someone.  Its almost like trying too hard messes everything up.   Just be yourself and be open to making friends and talking to other people.  The rest will happen eventually",

            "Question": "A child I\u2019m babysitting has very large bruises\nHi guys, I\u2019m new to this sub but I don\u2019t know what to do. I [18F] am currently watching two siblings (both under the age of 4), the oldest is still napping, but the youngest is a little girl and I just changed her diaper. When I went to wipe her, I saw a green and purple bruise spread across her entire bottom. It\u2019s very large. Could this be from spanking? I babysit for their best friends every other week as well, should I mention this to them? This is the first time I\u2019m sitting for them, the mom seemed very anxious but I just chalked it up to me being their first sitter ever. I was abused as a child but being in the situation of the grown up, I don\u2019t know what to do. Please help me. Do I take pictures of the bruise? What if nobody believes me without proof? Is that wrong?? I\u2019m going to check the oldest\u2019s bottom once he wakes up while I\u2019m changing him and see if there\u2019s something similar.\n\nUPDATE: The oldest\u2019s entire bottom and legs are bruised too. I have been able to take pictures of JUST their backs and the backs of the oldest\u2019s legs, as they have bruises all the way up their spines as well. Nothing from the photo could be taken as pornographic. I have looked at Mongolian Spots and didn\u2019t know about them prior to this issue, so thank you for those that have educated me. I did call the parents friends who I am very close with and trust, and they said they will help me out. I doubt that it\u2019s those though, they both have the same marks in the exact same spots and they\u2019re purple and look like bruises. I can see blood vessels. I\u2019ll keep y\u2019all updated. Thanks everyone.",
