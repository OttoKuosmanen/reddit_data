            "Question": "Should I break off the wedding? Fianc\u00e9 hates my dad to the point of hurting me\nEdit: explaining what fianc\u00e9 did to provoke dads behavior-he was having a bad day at work and yelled and was cussing not really at me-but in general. He also threw a drawer straight down on the floor because of how worked up he was. Once again none of it was at me or directed towards me in any way. But my dad felt like you shouldn\u2019t talk to my daughter in that way-\u201cshe\u2019s a lady.\u201d When he confronted my fianc\u00e9 my fianc\u00e9 said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have acted that way BUT-I was mad. My dad blew up because he felt since my fianc\u00e9 had to throw a BUT in there-he wasn\u2019t actually that sorry.\n\n\nI was raised by a single dad. My dad has a lot of faults-one of him is the way he talks to people is disrespectful and he has a temper. He never physically hurts anyone but he\u2019s not afraid of cussing someone out. I know he has wrongs but I also see the damaged side of him and what he went through after mom left. So I still love him for all the years he was hurt and raised me. \n\nAbout 2 months ago my dad got in a huge fight with my fianc\u00e9. My fianc\u00e9 was initially in the wrong. Dad got to the point where he went to my fianc\u00e9s work and cussed him out in front of his boss. And then went and told my fianc\u00e9s parents all his issues he has with me marrying my fianc\u00e9. \n\nI called my dad and yelled at him and told him he went way to far and didn\u2019t talk to him hardly for like 2 or 3 weeks. But I still love dad. As wrong as he may be. My fianc\u00e9 has not dropped it since. He brings it up about once a week how much of a jerk my dad is and how much he hates him. After I told him he needed to let it go because it was causing us to fight he stopped talking about it as much. But still brings it up occasionally. I try to let him get his temper out but then he will say something like I never want your dad at the house again. If you want to see him it can\u2019t be on my property. And I think to myself he hates my dad so much that he\u2019s willing to hurt my relationship with my dad because of what he did? Like I feel at that point he\u2019s ok with hurting me. \n\nI try to explain to my fianc\u00e9 that I know my dad did a bad thing but I feel he doesn\u2019t care about my feelings when he\u2019s making me take half the punishment by saying I don\u2019t want your dad to ever come over and see our new house. But he sees it as me defending my dads behavior. I\u2019ve tried to make him see my perspective for months. And I\u2019m also trying to register how much my dad embarrassed him and of how my fianc\u00e9 is acting is justified in any way\u2026..\n\nShould I break this or not?",

Your dad *going to your fiance's work and his parents* is WAY overstepping.\n\n3. Both these men seem to have serious anger issues, and need therapy. I think you could use a break from both of them.\n\n4. I strongly recommend you seek therapy, too, because growing up with your dad's anger issues seems to have normalized it for you, and that can set you up for making excuses for romantic partners with anger issues, too.",

            "Question": "My boyfriend (23m) is a dealer and won\u2019t get a legal job what do\nHello everyone, I (22f) am having a hard time with my bf (23m). We have been together for almost 6 years, as the title states he is a dealer. I have been trying to encourage him to get a job for years, and he acts like a complete man child about it, he has a temper problem when it comes to any kind of authority over him. Other than that we really don\u2019t get into disagreements so it makes this harder for me. When we started dating we only did it because it was what we had to do if we wanted food or shelter, but now he\u2019s became lazy. He just wants fast easy ways to get rich (y\u2019all don\u2019t even know how many crypto scams I have prevented him from giving our savings to) and not put in effort for anything he wants in life. Obviously I can\u2019t just change him and make him work, but idk what to do anymore and I\u2019m tired of it. To make things worse I\u2019m a very introverted person and don\u2019t have any near friends I could just move in with if I decided to leave. I hate saying I\u2019m with him only for financial reasons because I do really love him, but ultimately if I had the money I would have been gone long ago. He just keeps saying he\u2019s going to get a job as an \u201centrepreneur\u201d but as I said he wants everything handed to him with no effort.  Anyways what can or should I do?",

            "Question": "Is it worth reporting to the police that someone has accessed my back sunroom and killed (stabbed) my 2 pet birds?\nI have, or had now, 2 small pet birds. A budgie/parakeet and a canary. They both live in separate cages. Their cages are kept in a back sunroom. It seems I forgot to lock the outside access door when I went out (have had lots on my mind recently). When home I found they had been stabbed, cut up, inside their cages, blood and feathers. No valuables are kept in this room and I'm unsure if anything is missing. This is quite disturbing.\n\nThey are only small birds but were pets. I know it's not like having a cat or dog killed but I had trained these little guys to hand feed, use swings and the budgie had started to talk a couple of words. The canary was currently nesting with 4 eggs (infertile). \n\nI don't want to have the police laugh at me or be accused of wasting their time. Do you think they would take this seriously? I will be looking up about animal cruelty laws and attacks on pets etc anyway.\n\nWhat kind of sick person would kill a small animal inside a cage?\n\n\nThis might sound weird but over the weekend late at night someone tried to break down my front door. From the voices it was at least a couple of guys. They were calling out the name of an ex-friend. I'm in the process of getting a restraining order on that former friend as I believe they were involved somehow. I'm assuming the bird deaths are probably/obviously related to that somehow.\nUnsure now to add the birds onto that order too. Or just make a new separate report to the police. Or just try move on. As upsetting as this is I already have enough things currently to deal with in my life.\n\nJust thought some advice might help. My head hurts at the moment to think straight really.",

            "Question": "I just want my name change to be respected.\nI\u2019m going to try to make all of this simple to you guys since it\u2019s rocket-science to my family that I wanted a feminine name and gave it to myself. I just wanted to feel satisfied. \n\nI was born with a name that I did not like, so I changed it last year when I was 19. I\u2019m 20 now and my family still can\u2019t get with the program. I changed my name because I always hated it. My mom named me something so masculine. Before you guys get on me, I\u2019m aware that gender neutral names exist but this wasn\u2019t that. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cJordan\u201d or \u201cAlex\u201d situation. She named me after a famous male actor because she thought he was sexy and she\u2019d never heard of a girl with his name before. She said I was going to be named that no matter if I was a boy or girl. Then, to make shit even worse, she gave me a feminine middle name. I\u2019d been getting comments and questions about my name since I was in elementary school and I was seven years old telling myself that I\u2019d change my name because I was just so tired. I just wanted to not be embarrassed. \n\nThe last straw that lead me to change my name was when I was at work and a guy asked me my name. I told him and he raised a brow and asked \u201cLike the actor?\u201d and I told him yes. Then, he proceeded to say \u201cWell, you\u2019re still beautiful anyway\u201d and left. That was when I started the process of legally filing to change my name. \n\nWhen the name change did finalize and happen, my mom just couldn\u2019t understand my choice. She compared it to how transgender people change their gender (I couldn\u2019t get a grip on her comparison) and she compared my name to her name, saying she\u2019d been teased all her life but her name is very much just feminine and Biblical. People know she\u2019s a woman before they see her face but I had people thinking I was a guy before they ever even saw me because my name was so masculine.  She said I should\u2019ve took that as a good thing and used every excuse in the book to avoid understanding my perspective. She even said it was disrespectful. Disrespectful for me to want a girly name so that I can live within my girly self? Disrespectful for me to not want to feel bad when people made unnecessary comments and said that my birth name was a \u201cboy name\u201d? \n\nRegardless of me changing my name, my family still continues to call me by my old name. I\u2019ve tried to reenforce it but they just won\u2019t listen. However, they always expect me to respect them but deliberately choose to ignore my wishes. Only a FEW people in my family try to respect my name change and best believe I can only count on one hand. I\u2019ve received better support from friends. My dad told me on the phone that he would still call me by my birth name but he still mixes it up and calls me by both names. My big sister says she\u2019s not calling me by my new name because she\u2019s not used to it and I don\u2019t look like the name that I\u2019ve picked. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019ve done this for no reason. \n\nI\u2019m going to the military sometime this year and I\u2019ve made it a goal to get this respect thing situated. I\u2019m old enough to receive the same respect the adults in my family expect from me so if they\u2019re still doing this to me when I join, I\u2019m cutting them off. I even told myself that they\u2019d be banned from my wedding if I get married and even the birth of my children if I have any if they can\u2019t respect my choice. My wedding invites and baby shower invites would say my new name and I don\u2019t need any confusion or embarrassment when my family meets my future husband\u2019s family. The way my family is acting, they\u2019re going to miss out on all that stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s not THAT hard to call someone what they want to be called and I don\u2019t know what I can do to change them from being ignorant.\n\nEDIT: Why would my mom throw trans people in the mix when if I did want to be trans, I\u2019d have to take one less step considering the fact that my name literally used to be masculine? She set me up with a masculine name anyway so I wouldn\u2019t have had to change my name if I wanted to be a male. It makes no sense. Give a girl a masculine name and then get mad at her for wanting a feminine name instead? Am I wrong?",

It just mysteriously never showed up on the other ones I've tried, so I wonder if the mods just quietly deleted it, or never let it through.

Maybe advice, or information that seems relevant to any of it, or just your own stories if you\u2019ve been through anything like this or find any of my problems relatable.  I want to know it isn\u2019t just me. There\u2019s a lot to unpack here, and I don\u2019t know how to organize it all, so here we go! It\u2019s going to be incredibly hard to follow, and I\u2019m sorry for that.\n\n---\n\nI seem to be broken.  The hardware is all there, but the software was never installed,  Maybe the software is in there, but too buggy to work.  I don\u2019t know.  All I know is I\u2019m 25 and have never had sex, and don\u2019t really have desire to.  I mean\u2026 I want to try, now, sort of, but haven\u2019t always.  I want someone to appreciate my body.  I wish I had let someone appreciate it when it was younger and stronger and tighter.  I age, and lose my opportunity to explore, to be desired.  I am not religious; it is not that Catholic Shame that prevents me from sex.  It just horrifies and disgusts me.  I evolved for multiplying, and the sex that is a necessity for it.  Sexuality is a big part of being a mammal, of being a human.  Why why why do I lack it?  I can enjoy looking at a man, generally don\u2019t enjoy looking at women the same way, and tend to be more comfortable when the view excludes the genitals.\n\nMy external sex organs feel uncomfortable and creep me out a bit, but not as bad as they used to.  I have not been a victim of sexual abuse.  I am not transgender.  I feel like a woman, and would be unhappy with a penis.  (Any ideas what could be up with me here?)  Physically and mentally, I am a woman; however recently I have come to wonder if it is possible to be psychologically one gender but *socially* the other, if that makes sense.  The way a man treats a male friend is very different than a woman treats a woman, a woman treats a man, or a man treats a woman.  There is a specific kind of friendship and interaction I have only ever observed between men, and it saddens me that it is unlikely I will ever fully experience that type of bond.\n\nBesides this lack of sex drive and such, I am not much of a people person.  I have my one good friend, and that was all I needed, but I\u2019m losing him through no intention of either of us.  I have made a few work friends, even having gone to parties with some and out to a restaurant for drinks with another, but find it hard to be with people.\n\n---\n\nWe were originally \u201cpen-pals\u201d (keyboard pals).  I was in university and heavily struggling.  It turns out I had some wild anemia that should have left me completely incapable (but somehow didn\u2019t quite) and some fucky hormones that were making it hard to function, but I didn\u2019t get those answers when I needed them.  I felt very overwhelmed and alone, ended up on a penpal-finding site, and he messaged me.  At first, I was annoyed by his comment that he, too, knew how it felt, to feel like one was getting left behind in a world that was moving on too fast, but kept that thought to myself and kept the conversation going.  Turns out, he really did know, better than I.\n\nWe became great friends.  We could tell each other anything.  I learned he was ill, lost most his friends because of it (when he couldn\u2019t party, the partiers left; when he couldn\u2019t work, those relationships dissolved; when he couldn\u2019t play cricket, his teammates were no longer teammates).  He left home at 17 to escape an abusive alcoholic father, worked so hard on his education, got his degree, and I imagine life was finally becoming okay.  He only got to work a few years at the career he fought for before he became ill, and eventually couldn\u2019t physically perform regardless of how hard he pushed.  He and I found each other and became pen-pals a few years later, at which point he was mobile within his home and usually managed to get outside a little bit once every few days.\n\nHe was (is?) fun and upbeat, charismatic, witty.  I was surprised to eventually learn that he had gone through some sexual and emotional abuse/trauma that left him with body dysmorphia, feeling worthless and unlovable, on-and-off suicidal with several botched attempts.  Even before this came out, we were very close, and it made me more comfortable with being open about my own struggles with the idea of sex.  Our problems here were very different, but somehow also very much the same.\n\nYears of phone calls and photos and daily text-chats went by.  He\u2019d often express his regret that I wasn\u2019t from somewhere closer (\u201cshame you\u2019re not local\u201d); we\u2019d talk about how nice it would be if I could just pop in for a cup of tea and a visit, sometimes.  We\u2019d discussed the possibility of me coming to meet him, someday.  Perhaps that amount of long-distance communication is odd and unhealthy.  What do you think?  Can someone really be friends with a person they\u2019ve never met?  Were we too co-dependent?  \n\nAnyway\u2026 a couple years went by, and I ended up going traveling through a few countries that were close together.  At the last country, I ended up on his doorstep.  He didn\u2019t know I was coming, and I had found a few accommodations (hostels and campgrounds) nearby that I\u2019d intended to check out and check into one of once I arrived.  I thought he\u2019d probably chat with me on his doorstep, and if things went well I would come back and spend more time with him other days.  To my surprise, this beautiful, generous, vulnerable human who had no idea I was coming *trusted* me, opened up his little home to me, and made it clear that I was welcome to anything in it.  Though he is just renting one room in the house, I ended up there at a point where 3 others had just left and a fourth was in the process of moving out and no longer lived there, so we had privacy and the run of the house.\n\nWe watched movies together and played a board game he ordered.  We sat around and drank tea and listened to music and chatted and were our odd selves.  I had recently joined a cricket team in my home country, and he helped me practice his sport a bit outside.  He wanted to make sure I explored and did some touristy things, and would find me maps and send me off on adventures he couldn\u2019t follow on.  As I walked out the door, he\u2019d be grabbing me my the backpack to stuff in snacks and juice and the like.  He told me what foods I should try and where to get them, and once when I got home from a hike, I found he had made me a big pot of pasta.  I know that took a good bit of effort with his limited energy.  I felt so cared about.  I loved so well, and was so well-loved.  But, of course, I had to go back to my own country.  Those were a happy 10 days that I\u2019ve been chasing ever since.\n\nWe continued chatting via text and phone call, sharing photos and videos.  A few months later, we planned for me to return the next summer.  We thought I might get a YM Visa down the road, so I could live and work out there for a couple years, but I\u2019m getting older and trying to start a career, and am only eligible for that visa until I am 30, and I can\u2019t see this being a possibility in the next few years, so I guess that\u2019s that, then.  Yet another thing the pandemic ripped from me.\n\n After I left that first time, I kept becoming even fonder of him.  I loved him; I knew that for a long time.  He felt like a cool older brother, sort of, and I loved him that way.  But also I was discovering it was a versatile kind of love.  I *could* love him like a sibling.  I could love him as if he were my son, and I were ferociously maternally protective.  I could love him as a friend.  I felt a sort of attraction I\u2019d never felt, before, too.  I could love him romantically, if I so chose.  So I did, and once I spilled my guts out to him, he eventually came around to the idea as well.  I didn\u2019t push him; he just grew into the idea on his own.  We we became even closer, in this strange new way.  Eventually, I felt willing \u2013\u2013 excited, even \u2013\u2013 to try to explore some physical intimacy and sexuality with him.\n\nThe pandemic started getting attention a couple weeks before my flight would have left, and he urged me to cancel my ticket and try again when it was sorted out and safer in a few weeks.  Boy, if we knew then what we know now\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been 4 years since I\u2019ve seen him.  He\u2019s gotten gradually sicker the whole time, which was somewhat expected.  Most days he\u2019s not really well enough to chat back-and-forth, but will still text me to let me know he\u2019s okay.  On lucid/focused/better (never \u201cgood\u201d) days we chat and I see his old self peek out from time to time.  He is vaccinated, but caught COVID a while back, which also did not help things. I thought that post-covid would be a good time to slip in a visit, during the window which he had the antibodies from fighting off the infection and would be protected by both the vaccine and natural immunity.  He said he was too sick to visit (I think he\u2019s self-conscious about his situation; things must be unravelling over there) and too scared, and I watched that little window where I could visit without putting him in danger slowly close.\n\nI know I won\u2019t see him again, now.  I\u2019ve tried to come to terms with that for the last few years, but keep finding myself picking up scraps of hope.  I wish I could move on.  I\u2019ve tried.  I have a hard time finding people I can make connections with, and he was one of the precious few.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever experience a romantic connection again.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever feel ready to explore intimacy again.  I don\u2019t want to die a virgin, but I can\u2019t bring myself to even consider touching anyone else, yet.  Maybe the right person will come along, and be patient enough to stand by me for years as a friend, until I feel safe and secure and emotionally connected/intimate enough to try.\n\nI just can\u2019t stop thinking of all those little pockets of happiness we\u2019ve had, and all the happiness I never got the chance to have.  I imagined getting home from work and crawling into bed behind him, or making dinner while he kept me company.  I thought about the movies and music I wanted to share with him, all the cups of tea I wanted to drink with him.  I think about wanting to wake up to that bright face and its absurdly mobile eyebrows (he emotes with these in the most adorable, exaggerated way, lol), that beautifully rough voice and its prickly accent.  I never met his mum, but we sort-of interacted, and we somewhat communicated through him.  Early on, when we were just starting to get close as keyboard-pals, I guess he told his mum and sister about me.  They asked about me a few times over the year, and supposedly expressed fondness.  I\u2019ve asked about them some, too, and get the impression that I would get along with his little family very well.  As creepy as I\u2019m sure this is, I looked forward to meeting them, and am sad I will not.  I always thought I\u2019d bring his Mum a little pot of zinnias to first meet her, and we\u2019d probably end up drinking tea and talking about bits and bobs and\u2026\n\nanyway, I\u2019m rambling.  It\u2019s just a weird thing.  I always knew this relationship was a long shot and could never actually last, but I wanted to steal a few more happy moments in this life, and thought I could help supply some better moments to him, too, and it\u2019s hard watching that opportunity become an impossibility and not knowing whether I will ever feel such a connection again, or if I even want to feel such a connection with someone else.  I know this whole thing has been absolutely absurd from the beginning, but kind of wonderful, too.\n\n---\n\nWas this relationship always unhealthy?  Was it weird?  How do I get over it?  How do I move on?\n\nAny idea what's up with my sexuality?  What can I do about that?  I don't want my broken sexuality.  I want to be able to explore.\n\nWhat about my thought of being \"socially male\"?  Any idea what that might be?  Is there a term for it?",

We\u2019ve always lived in the same house, but since mom passed in \u201809, the quality of our home has completely went to hell. Never cleaned, etc, and was never forced to pick up or have a daily routine. I recently got on new meds to help w depression and to overall motivate me to live a better life while I do counseling and other things. Dad and I both are severely mentally ill, but he has never got treatment. He is retired now, but does nothing all day. The state of our house is completely unlivable at this point, mold to where one room is completely closed off and I can\u2019t breathe (I have asthma and severe allergies), it is also just filled with trash bags, etc. We have carpets in every room but kitchen and bathroom, all of which are completely destroyed, so much clutter to where it\u2019s unbearable and there is no living space (house is only 800 sqft). Dad sleeps on the nastiest couch with the dogs (we adopted before mom passed). I want to completely tear down the house and build a new one. He just wants to start on fixing the house by \u201cexpanding the closed off bedroom\u201d.

I asked him if he thought I was a \"normie\" too, and he went on an incredibly misogynistic tirade against me saying that I was a \"whore\" and a \"roastie\" (I looked up what it meant later and I was horrified) for pursuing my career (which has provided our family with lots of money, including that he benefits from!) and for openly talking about my past relationships before I met his father, and also because his father and were never married and now separated. He told me he hated me for ruining his life by waiting \"so long\" to have children which is why he was on the spectrum and had difficulty talking to people (many of my friends had children at my age and they did not have children on the spectrum, not that it's a problem anyway). And that was only the beginning, I do not wish to go into more detail, but I couldn't even say anything to him as I broke down crying. I loved my son and we were so close until that point and never before had anything so mean ever been said to me. I couldn't handle it. I didn't understand why he would say such horrible things to me, or how he could have learned such ideas. I am a progressive, and especially feminist, and I thought I was raising our son to hold the same values, but he became the complete opposite of what I wanted him to be.\n\nIn the aftermath of this, I confiscated his computer and phone, although I did let him send one last message to his horrible \"friends\" since he wouldn't stop screaming to us about how he couldn't just abandon them without saying anything. However, this did not help in any way. He began spending more and more time outside the house, which I thought was a good thing and that maybe he was socializing with his peers who didn't accept this sort of thing. I also noticed over the next few months that he was getting more and more muscular, I was proud of him, but I also did not want him to believe he had to prove his \"manliness\" by getting big muscles, he then cursed me out and told me I was trying to make him a \"soyboy\" (a term I did not know and had to look up) so he didn't care what I had to say. Eventually I find out he somehow managed to find a skinhead gang after school and they workout together... after I saw him with them, I screamed at him and then at them that they as grown men should stop trying to manipulate a teenage boy and there was no reason for him to spend time with strange men in their 20s and 30s.\n\nAfter that, I was very strict about everything he was doing. I would pick him up and drop him off, even though it meant I needed to take off time from work to do so. When I dropped him off at home, I locked the doors to make sure he could not escape before returning to work. However, this did not work either, and eventually I was called by the school principle who let us know that he and his school friends (who he has also convinced to become Nazis now!) had beaten a group of POC boys up and that he and his friends would receive a suspension as a result. I was so livid. I could not imagine the fact I was raising a future criminal, and he told me that I was a traitor for not being proud of him for being stronger than them and for beating up \"murderers of our people, rapists of our women, and invaders of our lands\". No reason can get to him, and no discipline can get to him. And now I AM SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES TOO, all my friends now assume I must be a racist because of my son, and don't want to spend time with me anymore. The other parents at the school avoid me. People who used to be friendly are now cold. I have no idea how to deal with this situation, can anyone here on Reddit give me good advice?",

Especially considering that he's already become violent, it shouldn't be hard to get him admitted. Be prepared to call law enforcement to get him into the facility. You cannot handle this on your own, and the time for outpatient therapy has passed. He'll likely be even more abusive to you in the short term, but in the long term it will be good for all of you.",

            "Question": "My Girlfriend is hanging out with people that she knows openly have a crush on her, as well as people that actively try to ruin our relationship, she refuses to listen to me when I protest.\nMy girlfriend has an issue with disconnecting with people, I\u2019m aware of this and I don\u2019t push her about it. However, we recently haven\u2019t been spending much time together because of how often her friend is staying at her place. They\u2019ve known each other since they were kids and I have no right to step in between them, the problem I have is she is fairly sure that he has a crush on her, at least a mild one. Even though it\u2019s something I\u2019m not quiet about disliking, they wouldn\u2019t stop talking to them even if I really tried (which I have.) the reason I tried wasn\u2019t because of the crush, it was because he\u2019s a extremely rude person, as well as a raging racist even though it\u2019s (Just a joke.) Which bothers me due to the fact I am African American. He\u2019s tried to ruin our relationship and she gossips with him about me as well, I love her but I\u2019ve found myself not showing it as much because of how uncomfortable I felt when I learned all of this. On top of all that, she\u2019s just now telling how many of the people she talks or talked to recently (Like a couple months) have a crush on her that she\u2019s aware of. She out right refuses to stop talking to any of them, I don\u2019t want to break up with her but I don\u2019t know what else to do.",
