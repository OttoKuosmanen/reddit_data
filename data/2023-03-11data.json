My entire family is kinda fucked up, so I like to stay away from them but when we go on trips he\u2019s always there, and my parents allow him and his family to visit us. \n\nOver text and phone calls he\u2019s always asking me if im interested in having sex, I usually brush it off cause wtf\u2026 who says that? But last night he sent me over $100, asking if I\u2019d send him nudes. I said no, and he sent me a pictures of his nudes. ( he\u2019s also in the army)\n\nHe also has said he likes that I\u2019m skinny, because I\u2019m \u201ceasier to bruise and hurt\u201d. I\u2019ve since blocked him but how can I explain this to my parents, I don\u2019t want to be around him ever again and I\u2019m not sure how to tell them, or if they\u2019d think I\u2019m being dramatic or lying.\n\nUPDATE: I told my dad, he\u2019s extremely pissed, he spoke to his dad, and his dad said this isn\u2019t the first time he\u2019s done this. His dad kinda brushed it off, we\u2019ll see where we go from here\n\nThanks In advance.",

            "Question": "Was I groomed by my teacher at 15? My therapist says I was. I\u2019m now 24 and the teacher is suddenly emailing me.\nThis is my first time using Reddit, so apologies in advance if i\u2019m doing anything incorrectly and sorry if this is too long.\n\nI was very close to a teacher at school when i was 15/16. She was a woman (29) and so am I. I suffered badly from panic attacks, anxiety, grief and depression. She would always comfort me and help me through it. She was caring and very good at teaching her subject. But some of her behaviour left me feeling very confused and uncomfortable. \n\nShe would discuss her personal life with me, including details about her relationship with her boyfriend and her sex life. She\u2019d say to me that i was one of her favourites, compliment my appearance sometimes and touch me often - like cradling my face or stroking my hair. She\u2019d often stare at me intently during class/around the school and mistakenly say my name when talking to another student or compliment me to other students.\n\nI found all of this really overwhelming and her intimidating. This led to me getting palpitations around her, feeling sick, weak/shaky or like i\u2019d pass out in her class. I couldn\u2019t eat my lunch before her lessons because i was afraid of how her behaviour made me feel. I always thought I just had a crush on her because she was a great teacher, attractive, and young. It made me question my sexuality at the time. \n\nAfter I left school in 2015, we stayed in touch for a few years through her school email very occasionally. I then found out that she\u2019d left the school and heard nothing from her for 4 years.\n\nI\u2019m now 24 and suddenly a few days ago, she emailed me through her personal email and I was shocked. I got the same feelings of nausea, shakiness and breathlessness that I got in her class. She said in the email that because it was International Women\u2019s Day, she thought of me and wanted to check how I am (odd?). She told me that she\u2019d left the school and also left teaching and she hopes i\u2019m \u201ccontinuing to be amazing\u201d.\n\nWhen i told my therapist about this all, she said that I had been groomed by my teacher at 15 and I was made to feel special by her, which then made me feel like I had a crush on her. \n\nI\u2019m finding it difficult to process because i thought this teacher was a good person and someone i missed, looked up to and loved. Am I in denial that I was groomed? Did she take advantage of me? I feel like what if I\u2019m making things up and the lines are blurry. The idea of \u201cbeing groomed\u201d makes me feel very upset, angry, almost \u2018dirty\u2019 and traumatised :(",

            "Question": "Came across my son's internet browsing history and I feel disgusted\nI am a 37 year old single mom to a 15 year old son. I was an orphan and was raised by my aunt and uncle who I didn't have a great relationship with and ended up running away at the age of 16. For 6 years after that I had been involved in a series of bad relationships and bad decisions and once my son was born, I promised myself that I would raise my son in a proper manner.\n\nI inculcated in him the idea of being open and sharing even if he he did something wrong. I never believed in punishment and always openly spoke and discussed things if he did something wrong. I worked as a waitress and for a while as a  stripper and have been subject to harassment quite often.  I was really disgusted with some of the men and I made sure that I thought my son the importance of respecting the human body. Growing up I was comfortable being nude around him till around a couple of years back where I started being a little conservative. I still pretty  comfortable being in underwear around him or walking around the house with no bra under my clothes.\n\nLast week, my laptop wasn't working, so I decided to use my son's computer. He wasn't home that day and I tried calling him to ask him if it was ok to use his computer. He didn't answer and I desperately wanted to get some work done, so I decided to use it anyway. Luckily I knew his pin and I was able to login. A part of me knew that as a teenager, he probably would be seeing porn, so I kept myself ready not to be judgemental and I even went to the extent of opening up an incognito window. I didn't realize that even in incognito, the auto suggest showed history. I was appalled when I saw my son has been watching incest themed porn, specifically mother and son.\n\nI don't know what to do and how to confront him. One one hand I don't want to show that I broke his trust and accessed his personal computer. I've personally done some research and also found out that this sort of porn  was not really uncommon . Ever since that day, I've been feeling uncomfortable about being around my son and feel a little violated . I want to talk to him about it, but I'm unsure how to go about it .\n\nEdit: Thank you for your advice, I've decided that I will see a therapist for myself first. Some of you pointed out that I shouldn't be roaming around in my underwear in front of my son , but do you think that is really something that has gotten inside my sons head? For e.g. How do we define what is appropriate or what is in appropriate? \n\nIt could be that I am over thinking things. My biggest fear is losing my son. He has been a constant in my life and it scares me knowing that I might push him away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

            "Question": "Need advice. Is this cheating?\nI feel so broken. My husband of 15 years, been together 25 did something that really upset me a month and a half ago, and instead of apologizing, he has been acting like I don't exist..(which is the cycle in our marriage, it happens almost every month) not talking to me, acknowledging me..just spending all of his time with our kids until there a huge blow up and we rencile after months and months of this treatment.\n\nWell, one of our daughter's friends mom is a widow. My husband has jokingly said in the past that if anything happens to me that she can be his sugar mama as she has a full time job and a house and I'm a stay at home mom with no income coming in.\n\nWell, we're at a soccer game the other day and our daughters (mine and the daughter of widow )are playing in the gym. I'm sitting next to my husband on the bleachers and we're not talking. I look over and he's texting the mom asking if she was able to make it (she wasn't there yet). I flipped out, demanded to see the phone and its a bunch of texts.\n\nSome background..our daughter went over for a playdate a couple weeks ago and my husband picked her up. They didn't come home for an hour, even though they live 10 minutes away. When I asked my daughter why it took so long, she said that the girls didn't want to stop playing and that my husband and the mom were in the kitchen talking.\n\nA week after that, we had her daughter here for a playdate. That night, husband texted a picture of our dog in the snow as he was taking her for a walk saying \" See, this is what you have to deal with when you have a dog lolol\" and then they were texting about that.\n\nThere were like 15 texts back and forth that I could see and a smiley a face from her that seemed to be in response to something he said that I think he quickly deleted before handing me the phone. I was SO upset and in the middle of a crowded gym so I really couldn't absorb everything. I know there was nothing sexual.\n\nI am so upset about this as I consider it cheating, but he is saying I'm crazy. He hasn't spoken to me in months, he's sitting next to me on the bleachers texting this woman as I'm sitting there. I feel so hurt, emotionally violated and disrespected.\n\nAm I being crazy or is this completely unacceptable behavior?",

There have been 4 occurrences within the last 6 weeks of bullying to the extent that my daughter is throwing up before school due to anxiety and has now missed a number of days.  This is Kindergarten for Christ's sake.\n\nWe have sent 4 emails detailing each occurrence.  The teachers and principal are involved, and after the 3rd occurrence, the parents of the bully were informed.  After this 4th occurrence we again sent an email and the principal essentially responded with \"all we can do is inform the other parents\".\n\nThis tells me that the school cannot address bullying.  They have told me they have \"safety plans\" but won't go into detail what those plans are, except that they are designed to address bullying etc.  Clearly these plans are not working.\n\nI'm really thinking that either the school is trying to protect itself, or that the teachers and principal have had their wings clipped to the extent that they can't actually use discipline etc.  I'm at a loss as to what to do here.\n\nI'm thinking of either escalating to the school board and / or engaging the media at this point.  Is this advisable or can anyone think of a better alternative?  I really don't want my daughter to switch schools.\n\nThanks",

            "Question": "How do I ask school admins to change playground rules?\nI have a really great 10 year old 4th grader. Smart, funny, kind and helpful. I may be biased but overall a mature and lovely person. She attends a newer public school, part of the inaugural kindergarten class so there for 5 years now. The school just put in a playground a few weeks ago and obviously the kids are all very excited. \n\nApparently, the admins have decided to put some rules in place, which makes sense in general. However, they have also assigned a group of students to be the \"safety committee\" to make sure the rules are being followed. These kids walk around during recess with clipboards and write names down. This doesn't sit right with me to begin with, but I'm having a hard time articulating why.\n\nI have not received a copy of the rules, but my kid says things like no running (um ok, shouldn't kids run and play outside?), 2 kids on the bars at a time, 5 \"tricks\" on bars (like flipping over), 20 swings on the swings. So the safety committee stands around with clipboards and write down names of rule violaters and if your name gets on the list 3 times you go to the principal. \n\nThis by itself just sounds so stupid to me so I'm looking for advice on how to approach this with the school. \n\nAdd to it that it seems no one informed the kids about the safety committee so all of a sudden there's just a bunch of narcs floating around giving kids anxiety about the threat of being in trouble.\n\nTop it all off with the fact that one of the kids on the safety committee was bullying my kid last year (nothing major but it was a friend that was jealous my kid was starting to spend time with other friends and bad enough that the bully was moved to a different class). So this bully is now targeting my kid and basically standing there watching them specifically every day. My kid tried to speak to admins without bringing up the bully specifically, just the rules and committee in general, and was basically told these are the rules and to deal. \n\nToday the bully told my kids teacher that they are watching closely since my kid breaks rules often. My kids teacher said that doesn't seem fair but didn't do much about it and suggested my kid write a letter to the admins. \n\nAny advice on how to approach this and make strong arguments against a safety committee of kids and general dumb playground rules?",

            "Aswer": "This is definitely something I feel you could raise a lot of very valid concerns about to the school. It is *an adult's* job to supervise children. What are their teachers doing during recess? Why aren't they able to supervise? Giving kids little jobs like Line Leader or Table Cleaner is a normal thing to do, but you have the kids switch out jobs every day or so, so everyone gets a turn, and you don't give some kids authority over other kids. There's no way that doesn't lead to bullying. I can almost guarantee that your kid isn't the only one getting unfairly targeted, so if you ask around the other parents you could get a whole group together to bring this up at a PTA meeting or something.",

            "Question": "Should I break off the wedding? Fianc\u00e9 hates my dad to the point of hurting me\nEdit: explaining what fianc\u00e9 did to provoke dads behavior-he was having a bad day at work and yelled and was cussing not really at me-but in general. He also threw a drawer straight down on the floor because of how worked up he was. Once again none of it was at me or directed towards me in any way. But my dad felt like you shouldn\u2019t talk to my daughter in that way-\u201cshe\u2019s a lady.\u201d When he confronted my fianc\u00e9 my fianc\u00e9 said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have acted that way BUT-I was mad. My dad blew up because he felt since my fianc\u00e9 had to throw a BUT in there-he wasn\u2019t actually that sorry.\n\n\nI was raised by a single dad. My dad has a lot of faults-one of him is the way he talks to people is disrespectful and he has a temper. He never physically hurts anyone but he\u2019s not afraid of cussing someone out. I know he has wrongs but I also see the damaged side of him and what he went through after mom left. So I still love him for all the years he was hurt and raised me. \n\nAbout 2 months ago my dad got in a huge fight with my fianc\u00e9. My fianc\u00e9 was initially in the wrong. Dad got to the point where he went to my fianc\u00e9s work and cussed him out in front of his boss. And then went and told my fianc\u00e9s parents all his issues he has with me marrying my fianc\u00e9. \n\nI called my dad and yelled at him and told him he went way to far and didn\u2019t talk to him hardly for like 2 or 3 weeks. But I still love dad. As wrong as he may be. My fianc\u00e9 has not dropped it since. He brings it up about once a week how much of a jerk my dad is and how much he hates him. After I told him he needed to let it go because it was causing us to fight he stopped talking about it as much. But still brings it up occasionally. I try to let him get his temper out but then he will say something like I never want your dad at the house again. If you want to see him it can\u2019t be on my property. And I think to myself he hates my dad so much that he\u2019s willing to hurt my relationship with my dad because of what he did? Like I feel at that point he\u2019s ok with hurting me. \n\nI try to explain to my fianc\u00e9 that I know my dad did a bad thing but I feel he doesn\u2019t care about my feelings when he\u2019s making me take half the punishment by saying I don\u2019t want your dad to ever come over and see our new house. But he sees it as me defending my dads behavior. I\u2019ve tried to make him see my perspective for months. And I\u2019m also trying to register how much my dad embarrassed him and of how my fianc\u00e9 is acting is justified in any way\u2026..\n\nShould I break this or not?",

Your dad *going to your fiance's work and his parents* is WAY overstepping.\n\n3. Both these men seem to have serious anger issues, and need therapy. I think you could use a break from both of them.\n\n4. I strongly recommend you seek therapy, too, because growing up with your dad's anger issues seems to have normalized it for you, and that can set you up for making excuses for romantic partners with anger issues, too.",

I had cancer before but was stage 3, then 10+ years later it came back much much worse. \n\nMy doctors were fantastic and called all over the country to see if they could find anyone with my specific diagnosis. They found a hospital that had done an experimental procedure 3 times. Out of those one worked, the others passed.  I had 4-6 months left or try this experimental procedure which could be deadly. \n\nMy family and friends were completely sympathetic but I alone had to deal with my decision either way. \n\nI decided to do the experimental procedure. I was scared shitless and consistently depressed. I was heavily medicated for anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn\u2019t get out of my own head for a long time. Fortunately I\u2019ve been in remission for 2 years. The other person who had the procedure and lived has now died. I don\u2019t know how long I have months to 20+ years.

            "Question": "My boyfriend (23m) is a dealer and won\u2019t get a legal job what do\nHello everyone, I (22f) am having a hard time with my bf (23m). We have been together for almost 6 years, as the title states he is a dealer. I have been trying to encourage him to get a job for years, and he acts like a complete man child about it, he has a temper problem when it comes to any kind of authority over him. Other than that we really don\u2019t get into disagreements so it makes this harder for me. When we started dating we only did it because it was what we had to do if we wanted food or shelter, but now he\u2019s became lazy. He just wants fast easy ways to get rich (y\u2019all don\u2019t even know how many crypto scams I have prevented him from giving our savings to) and not put in effort for anything he wants in life. Obviously I can\u2019t just change him and make him work, but idk what to do anymore and I\u2019m tired of it. To make things worse I\u2019m a very introverted person and don\u2019t have any near friends I could just move in with if I decided to leave. I hate saying I\u2019m with him only for financial reasons because I do really love him, but ultimately if I had the money I would have been gone long ago. He just keeps saying he\u2019s going to get a job as an \u201centrepreneur\u201d but as I said he wants everything handed to him with no effort.  Anyways what can or should I do?",
