            "Question": "I met up with my son after four years of no contact.\n \n\nOriginal Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/duplicates/11lcng9/my\\_son22m\\_cut\\_contact\\_with\\_me\\_43f\\_four\\_years\\_ago/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/duplicates/11lcng9/my_son22m_cut_contact_with_me_43f_four_years_ago/)\n\nFor the few that gave me actual advice, I went to meet up with my son without Max or my daughter. It was at a local coffee shop. I found him sitting in one of the booths at the coffee shop. He was on his phone. I was really scared. A part of me wanted to tackle him with a hug and beg for his forgiveness. Another part of me, wanted to leave before he noticed me. I said his name to get his attention. He didn't even leave his seat; he just looked at me and said hi. I asked if I could sit. I started asking about how is he doing. He said he was fine. I was about to apologize, but he interrupted me by saying, \"Before you apologize, I want to understand how the relationship between Max and you even started.\"\n\nI started telling him everything. When it came to mentioning my meet-ups, he interjected me and started asking me questions that were difficult to answer. He asked \"So all the times that you were going out you were lying to me about where were you going. Weren't you?\" I nodded. \"What about the times I asked to spend time with you? Did you lie to me so you meet up with Max instead?\" I started tearing up. It was hard being there. \"Did you miss out on events to be with Max? What about my birthday?\" That's when I started crying. He told me to save my tears. He said he figured that out soon after he learned about the relationship with Max. He just wanted to hear it from me. He then asked me if I was still with Max. I told him I was married to him and I have a daughter with him. He seemed to need a minute to process that.\n\nThen he started speaking. He told me he never had an issue with me dating or meeting someone. In fact, he hoped I found love. He understands that I needed companionship and a type of love he couldn't offer as my son. He told me throughout all these years he felt conflicted because both Max and I were both consenting adults and adults have a right to find happiness. My son admitted he shouldn't Max and was glad he didn't press charges. He said despite all of that, they were some things that he can't get over. He told me he can't get over the fact that I didn't take him into consideration when it came to pursuing the relationship. It was also hurtful to realize that I would value a romantic relationship to the point of being willing to throw away a close relationship with him for it. If I had the attitude of being done raising him and finally pursuing my own life, then that's valid, according to him. However, I would have no right to want to have a close relationship with him in return. Again, that's what he said he believes. He told me he wouldn't have forgotten me when he left for college. He would have wanted me to move close to him after he got a job if he couldn't move close to me. In this ideal world we would live close by so he we could still see each other even after he had a family.\n\nHe said he loves himself and his life too much to have back in my life.. My son said he works as a mechanical engineer now. He is engaged to the love of his life. She was also raised by a single mom like him until she was 16 when her stepdad into the picture. Both of them have welcomed him into the family. He told me his future in-laws and his fiance are his family now. He said he was getting a job near them.\n\nHe finally admitted that he just wanted closure before permanently cutting me off. He told me not to contact him or his family at all. He made it clear he wouldn't be there for me at my last stage of life or even come to my funeral. He made it clear he won't even hold my hand when I pass away. I won't have the privilege of knowing his fiance or his future kids. He made it clear that if his half-sister ever contacts him as an adult he'll be upfront on why he doesn't want a relationship with her. He said good bye to me and left. I cried so hard that I got the attention of the people in the coffee shop. I was crying on the way back home. I don't even know how therapy can even help. I never felt so much emotional pain in my life before. What do I do now?",

I\u2019m 33 and he\u2019s 34.\n\nMy husband guilted me out of going out saying he wasn\u2019t comfortable with it but not because he doesn\u2019t trust me. I rarely do anything besides work, take care of my children and home and visit family. My best friend invited me out for a night of dancing at a local bar. It was her sister\u2019s birthday and 5 or 6 other women were going. He said a married woman shouldn\u2019t be going out without her husband and at first suggested that he go and just \u201chang out\u201d in the bar. I told him that I thought that would be weird, him just standing in a corner of the bar watching us. He then sent me several pictures of posts where people had asked if their wives should go out without their husband which of course supported his opinion. He also sent me a very long text explaining that he wasn\u2019t comfortable with it. Saying that he doesn\u2019t trust other people and he thinks it\u2019s just wrong for a married woman to go out to a bar where people go looking to \u201chook up\u201d. I just wanted to go out with a group of ladies to dance.",

They paid for all the hospital expenses, pampered her, let us stay at their house. It was the best option for us at the time, cause neither of us felt right getting an abortion, but knew we weren't ready to be parents. Flash forward to now, that girl and I broke up more than a decade ago, good riddance honestly. I met my NOW wife a few years after the break up, we have two boys, and life is good. Parenting is hard, I do not regret what we did and the choices we made. The way our relationship went after the adoption was horrible. She cheated, manipulated, tormented. The true colors showed once we were out of high school and got to expirence the real world. Just weigh your options man, think about your future self. Good luck and hope you the best.",

            "Question": "(Update): My ex-bestfriend, who is married to my ex-husband hired me to make a cake for her son's birth.\n Hi, guys. I have read your advice and suggestions. You all made some really good points. So, I decided to talk to my mom about it. I just needed her insights about this matter. She told me I should do what I want to do. My boyfriend also encouraged me to take the order. He says that if I had to stay to organize the dessert table he would be there for me. I took the order. And it turns out, it was my ex husband\u2019s idea to hire me. Because one of his colleagues recommended my services to him. And it was sort of short notice so I had to rush this. Anyways, I kept it strictly about business. I did take the payment in advance just like some of you have mentioned. I always ask for advance payments. I mostly maintained communication through email. I have an assistant who is also a family friend of mine to handle all communications. My ex-bsf tried many times to meet with me in person, but I told her to just email me because I do have cake orders for other people too. I only had to meet her 1 time in person regarding the order. She sent me the details of the party over the email. \n\nAnd like I mentioned it was a huge order. I didn\u2019t just have to make a birthday cake for the baby (it is pokemon themed). There were also cake pops, cupcakes and macarons. Luckily, I had my friend Marie over for some help (yes, I did pay her). So, like usual I went to deliver the cakes and other stuff for the party. There was already a table set at the venue. My boyfriend, Josh (35M) came with me to support me and to keep me away from my ex-husband and ex-bsf as much as possible. As I was busy with myself, my ex approached me and said hello. Ngl, seeing him after so many years my heart just stopped. This man has given me the worst pain you could possibly give to a human. I am glad I held my composure. I also said hello back. He tried to have a small talk with me by saying that he is sorry about how things went down and what he said and also I looked better than the last time he saw me. Then he drops a big bomb, he said all these years he has thought of me, wondering what I was doing even though he is happy with his married life. I was silent. I didn\u2019t say a word. He just kept spewing that he misses me and my cooking. My homemade french onion soup is still his favorite. He misses that every time he gets sick with a flu. I didn\u2019t know what to say. At that moment Josh noticed that my ex was making me uncomfortable and he rushed towards me with a fake emergency. He asked if I was ok, I said yes. \n\nAfter the table setting was done, I was about to leave, that\u2019s when I saw my ex-FIL along with other guests. He noticed me and came to give me a hug. My ex-FIL is a very humble man. In fact he was the only man who was on my side when I was going through a divorce with his son. He looked really happy to see me and asked me how I was. He started to chat with me. I talked to him about my business and he gave me some advice. He even talked to my boyfriend. He called Josh a \u201cpretty standard guy\u201d (whatever that means). Ex-FIL was nice and said he would suggest my services to his friends too. He insisted that I stay until lunch is served. I said no a couple of times but he managed to convince me. I only stayed for 1 more hour or so. But I was fine. I did notice that my ex-bsf was eyeing me from the corner. I was fine because Josh was beside me the whole time. I chatted with some guests. They appreciated my service. I didn\u2019t have any more conversations with my ex. I didn\u2019t even stay for the cake cutting. I left the first chance I got but my assistant stayed to make sure everything was fine and for the clean up. \n\nIt was overwhelming for me. I saw some of my old friends and my in-laws. My MIL avoided me and some of my old friends just said hello. Later that day I got a message from my ex-bsf on my work email that she liked my service and that her guests really liked my cakes and desserts. She also said sorry. That\u2019s not where it ends. I got to know from my friend Marie, who is still in contact with some of my old friend group that my ex-bsf is not happy with her marriage. When my ex and her are in public they would often fight a lot. They also fight on the day of their kid\u2019s birthday. Tbh I just told her to not bring me the gossip about her. But the silver lining is I got a huge fat check lol. I can finally buy a new sugar printer or maybe a good quality oven. Also, I just want to appreciate my boyfriend Josh. He has been incredibly supportive of me. He has protected me from my ex and ex-bsf like a knight. I think he deserves his own cake from me. \ud83d\ude09 And I know a lot of you told me not to take it. But I guess I am just a greedy Mr. Krabs who cares more about the money rather than being classy hehe. But this is the last time I will be taking any orders from them. I know they have a 3 yr old daughter whose birthday will be in 2 months. I think they might try to hire me again. I will not take it if that happens. \n\nP. S. Yes my ex-bsf did try to communicate with me during the party but I managed to avoid it thanks to Josh and my ex-FIL. My ex-FIL knows about my situation and my discomfort with my ex-bsf. He kept me busy with small talk.",

Not sure if you can call it racism cause I know people say that can\u2019t be experienced by white people, but damn she\u2019s making my job hell.\n\nI\u2019m constantly stressed and anxious because I know if anything bad happens, even if it\u2019s HER FAULT, she will somehow blame me or my white boss. I feel like I can\u2019t talk or ask questions because she will get mad. Our bosses know about this and we all hate her but they are trying to get them to resign our contract so they won\u2019t say anything. \n\nAny advice or suggestions on how to deal with this? I feel terrible especially for my white bosses who take constant insults and rudeness from her and have continuous panic attacks over it.",

            "Question": "Need advice. Is this cheating?\nI feel so broken. My husband of 15 years, been together 25 did something that really upset me a month and a half ago, and instead of apologizing, he has been acting like I don't exist..(which is the cycle in our marriage, it happens almost every month) not talking to me, acknowledging me..just spending all of his time with our kids until there a huge blow up and we rencile after months and months of this treatment.\n\nWell, one of our daughter's friends mom is a widow. My husband has jokingly said in the past that if anything happens to me that she can be his sugar mama as she has a full time job and a house and I'm a stay at home mom with no income coming in.\n\nWell, we're at a soccer game the other day and our daughters (mine and the daughter of widow )are playing in the gym. I'm sitting next to my husband on the bleachers and we're not talking. I look over and he's texting the mom asking if she was able to make it (she wasn't there yet). I flipped out, demanded to see the phone and its a bunch of texts.\n\nSome background..our daughter went over for a playdate a couple weeks ago and my husband picked her up. They didn't come home for an hour, even though they live 10 minutes away. When I asked my daughter why it took so long, she said that the girls didn't want to stop playing and that my husband and the mom were in the kitchen talking.\n\nA week after that, we had her daughter here for a playdate. That night, husband texted a picture of our dog in the snow as he was taking her for a walk saying \" See, this is what you have to deal with when you have a dog lolol\" and then they were texting about that.\n\nThere were like 15 texts back and forth that I could see and a smiley a face from her that seemed to be in response to something he said that I think he quickly deleted before handing me the phone. I was SO upset and in the middle of a crowded gym so I really couldn't absorb everything. I know there was nothing sexual.\n\nI am so upset about this as I consider it cheating, but he is saying I'm crazy. He hasn't spoken to me in months, he's sitting next to me on the bleachers texting this woman as I'm sitting there. I feel so hurt, emotionally violated and disrespected.\n\nAm I being crazy or is this completely unacceptable behavior?",

            "Question": "Bullying in kindergarten teachers and principal are powerless to address it, help!\nHi All, begging for some advice here.\n\nLong story short my daughter is getting bullied and on occasion, pushed and shoved around by a bully in her class.  There have been 4 occurrences within the last 6 weeks of bullying to the extent that my daughter is throwing up before school due to anxiety and has now missed a number of days.  This is Kindergarten for Christ's sake.\n\nWe have sent 4 emails detailing each occurrence.  The teachers and principal are involved, and after the 3rd occurrence, the parents of the bully were informed.  After this 4th occurrence we again sent an email and the principal essentially responded with \"all we can do is inform the other parents\".\n\nThis tells me that the school cannot address bullying.  They have told me they have \"safety plans\" but won't go into detail what those plans are, except that they are designed to address bullying etc.  Clearly these plans are not working.\n\nI'm really thinking that either the school is trying to protect itself, or that the teachers and principal have had their wings clipped to the extent that they can't actually use discipline etc.  I'm at a loss as to what to do here.\n\nI'm thinking of either escalating to the school board and / or engaging the media at this point.  Is this advisable or can anyone think of a better alternative?  I really don't want my daughter to switch schools.\n\nThanks",

I didn't appreciate this, I'm straight and seeing another guys private parts does make me feel a bit sick, I tired to ignore it and made more banter and told him to not do it again, he apologised and we continued talking like usual, but I can't help but think why, is this normal behavior around guys? Or is it something else that I don't know about, as far as I know he's straight so I'm just confused, anyone got any advise?",

            "Question": "EX GF spread false allegations that I'm an abuser and it cost me my dream job.\nTitle says it all. My ex (as of 19 months ago) contacted me about a month ago about a kitchen utensil she wanted back. I told her I would get it to her but was busy with my job, and wouldn't be able to get it to her until the next week. When I returned from my trip, she had made an account on social media impersonating me and making fun and slandering my name. I told her to take it down or that I would get the authorities involved and she called me an abuser and asked me to leave her alone.\n\n2 hours later my friend calls me and tells me about a video on her story that states that I'm an abuser. I go to the police and do the legal stuff.\n\n3 weeks later (yesterday) I received a message informing me that I was no longer employed, and was wished the best of luck. This job was my DREAM. It was the perfect job for me, the one I'd grew up wanting. I called a coworker and they agreed that it was because of her messaging my boss and telling him i abused her when we dated and am still now. Now I'm in debt, can't pay bills, and feel lost and defeated. I'm blown away that this whole thing got this far, and I don't know what to do.\n\nTLDR: Ex gf accused me of abuse back when we dated.
