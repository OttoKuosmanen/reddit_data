            "Question": "My boyfriend said he\u2019s not paying rent while he\u2019s deployed\u2026\nSo I just recently found out that my boyfriend will be getting deployed in a few months. He\u2019s supposed to be leaving this month for pre deployment training and told me to pay his half for him and gave me his card info. So I guess being naive I said \u201cwill I be doing the same thing while your deployed?\u201d To which his reply was \u201cNo, why would it be fair for me to pay rent for a place I\u2019m not going to be living in for up to 6-9 months.\u201d It caught me way off guard because I moved all the way to OK from NH because he told me he wanted us to live together, that\u2019s 22 hours away. I have no family or friends down here and I even had to pay and drive a Penske truck just to get here\u2026 what am I supposed to do? I don\u2019t want to be here all alone and I definitely don\u2019t want to be financially responsible for an apartment that has the rent continuously increasing almost every month. My best friend and family keep telling me that I should leave him because the way he already treats me and then when I told them about this they lost their minds\u2026 Is there any other people that are dating a service member and have they left you solely responsible for rent while they where away?",

It doesn\u2019t matter how often either of you are there. The man signed a contract and he\u2019s obligated to hold himself to that contract. \n\nBased on the rest of your post, it sounds like the most straightforward solution would be to not pay your half of the rent because you left the douchebag.",

            "Question": "Is it normal to love your family but want to move far away and have nothing to do with them?\nI (23M) live with 2 parents and a younger brother. My parents are really great people and I love them to death. I would do almost anything for them if I they ever needed help, hope to financially support them if able and wish them the best in life. Same applies to my younger brother. However, I absolutely hate living together and being within touching distance where I have to interact and talk to them, or even see them for that matter. I would like to move as far away from them as possible and cut off frequent contact. I would not mind talking to them every once in a while to check up (once a month, let\u2019s say). And going to see them for a couple of days a year. I want to live a life completely separate from them in which they are not involved. Am I lying to myself by saying that I love them ? Can both of my feelings coexist ? I feel guilty for wanting what I want.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the kind replies everyone! Helps to know I\u2019m not actually a dick haha. I definitely agree with it being an autonomy thing. However, they come from a culture that is very interdependent family wise. That is probably why I felt like it\u2019s such a \u2018bad\u2019 thing to not want the same.",

Help!\nMy son (20) has been with his girlfriend (20) for about 5 months and she's just moved in with us as she doesn't get along with her parents but she comes with issues that I'm not used to or know how to deal with.\n\nShe's not working so my son and I are supporting her. I've been trying to help her find work but she's not making an effort.\n\nWhen it was me and my son, I'd put food in the fridge (cooked meats, salads, bread, sandwich wraps etc) and he'd take care of himself but his girlfriend always asks for cooked meals for lunch and dinner and to make it worse, she won't eat left overs or the same thing twice in one day. Won't even eat them the next day.\n\nWhen I do cook meals, she loads her plate up so full that she can't eat it all. Ends up in the fridge but as I said, she won't eat left overs so it gets thrown out.\n\nIn the mornings when I first wake up, I like to sit in peace and have my coffee, watch the morning news etc but she right there non stop talking and doesn't seem to take a breath.\n\nShe's not a bad person. She's actually a lovely girl who clearly hasn't had the best upbringing. If we could get these small issues sorted, I feel we'd have a much better relationship.\n\nHow do I help her understand that these things are not ok without hurting her?",

A few months ago we recommended two married friends of ours who I will call Mark and Lisa for membership. We invited them for a meet and greet with other members one evening at an upscale lounge. \n\nLisa likes to dress very sexy and youthful. She is 60 years old, on the heavier side, and has very large breast implants that she can never seem to keep inside her clothes. She showed up to the evening wearing platform flip flops and a semi-see-through beach romper that left nothing to the imagination. When the evening was over, several members shared their feedback and gave her a hard \u201cno\u201d for membership. Some cited a \u201cpersonality conflict\u201d but others stated that they found her appearance and dress to be \u201ctrashy\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201ccontradictory to the public persona our group is trying to establish.\u201d  Needless to say they did not become members. \n\nI love my friend. She is kind, funny, hardworking, and would give you the shirt off her back (no pun intended). I don\u2019t judge her for her clothing choices but I do feel uncomfortable sometimes when we hang out, husbands in tow, and she has yet another (entirely preventable) wardrobe malfunction. Do I tell her how wildly inappropriate this is?  Or do I bite my tongue and accept her and her fashion choices?  Thanks.",

Then got next to the car and refresh the app, if there is a tracker in or on the car you'll notice a new device appearing in the app. Look at the distance which is in meters, then walk around to different sides of the car, and look at the distance. The lower the distance means the closer you are to the Air Tag. The app should display Air Tag so it should be really easy to find in the app when looking at it. I'd also recommend maybe doing this search with her car at least 75 feet from all other cars and bluetooth device that are on phones and cars. It should be super easy to find.

            "Question": "I met up with my son after four years of no contact.\n \n\nOriginal Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/duplicates/11lcng9/my\\_son22m\\_cut\\_contact\\_with\\_me\\_43f\\_four\\_years\\_ago/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/duplicates/11lcng9/my_son22m_cut_contact_with_me_43f_four_years_ago/)\n\nFor the few that gave me actual advice, I went to meet up with my son without Max or my daughter. It was at a local coffee shop. I found him sitting in one of the booths at the coffee shop. He was on his phone. I was really scared. A part of me wanted to tackle him with a hug and beg for his forgiveness. Another part of me, wanted to leave before he noticed me. I said his name to get his attention. He didn't even leave his seat; he just looked at me and said hi. I asked if I could sit. I started asking about how is he doing. He said he was fine. I was about to apologize, but he interrupted me by saying, \"Before you apologize, I want to understand how the relationship between Max and you even started.\"\n\nI started telling him everything. When it came to mentioning my meet-ups, he interjected me and started asking me questions that were difficult to answer. He asked \"So all the times that you were going out you were lying to me about where were you going. Weren't you?\" I nodded. \"What about the times I asked to spend time with you? Did you lie to me so you meet up with Max instead?\" I started tearing up. It was hard being there. \"Did you miss out on events to be with Max? What about my birthday?\" That's when I started crying. He told me to save my tears. He said he figured that out soon after he learned about the relationship with Max. He just wanted to hear it from me. He then asked me if I was still with Max. I told him I was married to him and I have a daughter with him. He seemed to need a minute to process that.\n\nThen he started speaking. He told me he never had an issue with me dating or meeting someone. In fact, he hoped I found love. He understands that I needed companionship and a type of love he couldn't offer as my son. He told me throughout all these years he felt conflicted because both Max and I were both consenting adults and adults have a right to find happiness. My son admitted he shouldn't Max and was glad he didn't press charges. He said despite all of that, they were some things that he can't get over. He told me he can't get over the fact that I didn't take him into consideration when it came to pursuing the relationship. It was also hurtful to realize that I would value a romantic relationship to the point of being willing to throw away a close relationship with him for it. If I had the attitude of being done raising him and finally pursuing my own life, then that's valid, according to him. However, I would have no right to want to have a close relationship with him in return. Again, that's what he said he believes. He told me he wouldn't have forgotten me when he left for college. He would have wanted me to move close to him after he got a job if he couldn't move close to me. In this ideal world we would live close by so he we could still see each other even after he had a family.\n\nHe said he loves himself and his life too much to have back in my life.. My son said he works as a mechanical engineer now. He is engaged to the love of his life. She was also raised by a single mom like him until she was 16 when her stepdad into the picture. Both of them have welcomed him into the family. He told me his future in-laws and his fiance are his family now. He said he was getting a job near them.\n\nHe finally admitted that he just wanted closure before permanently cutting me off. He told me not to contact him or his family at all. He made it clear he wouldn't be there for me at my last stage of life or even come to my funeral. He made it clear he won't even hold my hand when I pass away. I won't have the privilege of knowing his fiance or his future kids. He made it clear that if his half-sister ever contacts him as an adult he'll be upfront on why he doesn't want a relationship with her. He said good bye to me and left. I cried so hard that I got the attention of the people in the coffee shop. I was crying on the way back home. I don't even know how therapy can even help. I never felt so much emotional pain in my life before. What do I do now?",

I have curly hair so my curls will most likely not be the same also. \n\nI wanted a refund for this experience. These stylist did whatever they wanted to me. Bleached my hair and dyed it twice in 1 day. Instead the stylist and the owner start yelling at me telling me they can't refund me and that I'm wasting their time and that the most they could do for me is give me some type of moisturizing treatment the next time I come in. (They are so clueless) I explain that I'm never coming back and leave with damaged hair, orange roots, and redish/brown hair, a lousy blowout, an uneven trim, and the delight of being shouted at by two extremely unprofessional ladies. Not to mention I paid $140 for this nightmare.\n\nI spoke to friends they're all in shock of such an experience and they warn me that in a couple of months, my hair might fall out bc of the bleach \ud83d\ude22 . I am considering suing this business. What are your thoughts?",

Is there anything I could do?\nHe never got any repercussions for molesting me multiple times when I was 6-10 years old, and now he just physically assaulted his sister. They both live a block  away from me. I have a recording of him admitting it on the phone. She doesn\u2019t want to call the police. He\u2019s not remorseful. It\u2019s triggering me really bad that once again he\u2019s not going to be punished. Is there anything I can do, or do I have to just take the L on this one and sit with my anger? Their mom witnessed it, but she doesn\u2019t want him to go to jail. I want him gone from our lives. He\u2019s a disgusting piece of trash person.\nEdit: people are assuming his sister is a child. He is 29, his sister is 31.\n\nEdit again: they were arguing and he grabbed her hair or ear and threw her on the floor. Then he ran to his room and locked the door. I believe he\u2019s still locked in his room and everyone is comforting his sister and their mom, who has a heart condition, and is hysterical since she witnessed it",

            "Question": "My sister (F56) is angry with me (F51) for buying my nephew (M18) Plan B, and I've been getting harassed and accused of being inappropriate for it.\nI (F51) live with my husband Brian (M55) only around half an hour away from my sister Lisa (F56), BIL Harold (M55), and nephew Robby (M18). Robby's in his senior year of high school and he's honestly always been a good kid. I love that little brat.\n\nHowever, a few nights ago, I was in the middle of watching cobra kai while Brian was at work. I get a frantic call from Robby. I'll spare the details but he said that he had no money and was in emergency need of Plan B for his girlfriend (F18). He begged me not to tell his parents, and I agreed to it. It's worth noting that he doesn't have a car just yet, and apparently neither does his girlfriend. The kid was freaking out and screaming on the phone, so I took some time to calm him down and reassure him that his future was not ruined and everything was going to be okay.\n\nI went to the nearby CVS and even bought two Plan Bs in case this happens again in the future, and drove down to Robby. My sister and BIL were out for the night, and Robby couldn't thank me enough. I told him not to mention it and also advised him to stay careful in the future. Robby begged me to keep this between us, and I agreed to spare him embarrassment. Unfortunately, I got an angry call from Lisa the next morning, and she had found the other Plan B in Robby's bathroom drawer while she was cleaning the bathroom. She said it was out of line for me to go and do that behind her back, and that I should've told her and Harold. I said that Brian was freaking out and I didn't want to embarrass him or make him feel bad, but Lisa said I was an AH for interfering with her parenting, and that me \"advising him to stay careful in the future\" was an inappropriate thing to say to my own nephew. It's literally gotten to a point where Harold and even a couple of Lisa's friends have been messaging me. I haven't even told Brian about this to keep Robby's word. I wasn't judging him at all, I really was just trying to help.\n\nSince then, I've still been getting messages from Lisa, Harold, and their friends. I haven't responded to a single one, and I even posted to AITA about this before it got taken down. I got a lot of advice on giving Robby the talk, but I'm extremely worried about how inappropriate that's just going to look. But at the same time, I fear that Robby might be uneducated on this stuff, as Lisa and Harold have honestly always been weird about this. Where do I go from here?",

It limits the damage of high calorie, low volume foods.\n\nNobody ever put on unwanted fat from eating too much steamed broccoli or too many apples. \n\nSimple changes are change white to brown: brown rice, not white, whole sweet potatoes vs white, whole wheat flour (breads, etc.) vs white, etc. The \" brown\" is about the fiber, which is more filling and less calories than the starches. \n\nDon't drink your calories. Don't eat any cheese you can't taste. If you can't tell the difference, don't add it. If you want alcohol, stop with the added calories and sugary mixes. Buy good booze and drink it straight. If you want the buzz, do it on an empty stomach because it takes a whole lot less. \n\nFollow a simple rule: if it's not in the house,  you can't eat it. This holds true for Twinkies and apples. So fill up the house with what you do want to be eating and never with what you don't.  \n\nTreat calories like money. If you went on a shopping spree and over spent, would you say \"fuck it\" and run up all the credit cards and take out a 2nd mortgage? No you would not! Don't do it with it food either. If you screw up, you screw up.
