            "Question": "How can I stop masturbating for 10-12 hours a day?\nHow can I stop masturbating for 10-12 hours a day? Yes, this is a serious question and not a troll even though it may sound like one. I know, it's weird. I've been addicted to masturbation, edging, and porn since I was 12 years old, and my addiction has never been worse than it is right now.\n\nTo break it all down for you, I typically edge to porn for around 10-12 hours a day, sleep for 4-6 hours a night, and then spend the remaining 6-8 hours of my day getting my priorities done (going to class, studying, and doing my homework). I'm still doing well in all of my college courses, and I enjoy learning and feeling successful by getting stellar grades. So at least that hasn't changed for me. \n\nBut besides that, I just masturbate for 10-12 hours a day and sleep for a little bit. I can't even remember the last time that I slept for more than seven hours in a single night. It's probably been around two months now. I wish that I could stop, but I don't really have a reason to at the same time. I don't have a girlfriend to make love with or anything. \n\nSo, how can I stop? At the end of the day, I do realize that this is really unhealthy and that I need to get rid of this addiction.",

So I'm sure they are grateful and really do appreciate you helping them out. 20 bucks doesn't seem like a lot, but when you're on the streets you can make it go far. Sure I'd buy alcohol, and I was mostly honest about it, (Yo, can you spare some change for alcohol and I promise you I won't buy food) was my line, but most the time I'd buy food lol. \n\nSo they'll more than likely will be getting their fix or maybe they'll get food, but now when I give back, after the money leaves my hand to theirs it's really none of my business what they spend it on. I normally say \"Get whatever you need\" when I give people money. \n\nI personally don't think it's foolish, but at the end of the day you need to be sure you can take care of yourself.

            "Question": "I Think My Husband Could Be Plotting To Kill Me\nTL;DR Discovered my husband has for a while been telling people I'm suicidal, and am generally mentally unstable. It's occured to me this could be part of an attempt to make it look like I commited suicide if I were to die suddenly. Am I being paranoid?\n\nI (26f) Have recently found reason to suggest my husband (29M) could be plotting to kill me and make it look like a suicide.\n\nYes, I realise how out there that sound, let me explain-\n\nMy reason for thinking is is because I discovered he has been secretly telling people we know, for a while, that I am apparently suicidal, along with other things to make me seem mentally unstable, as far as lying about having to call the police because I was a missing person. Recently the thought came to my mind, that this could be a way of making my death appear like a suicide, if he were to kill me, and I wanna share those thoughts to see what others think \n\nIt started after he one night told me not to go into the local store he works at, as he left early and had apparently used me as an excuse. Then not long after he happened to leave his messages open, and I noticed a conversation with his coworker about me, so curiosity got the better and I took a snoop. Turns out the excuse he'd used about me, was claiming that I'd gone missing and he needed to go look for me, adding the detail that I'm 'on suicide watch' even saying that he called the police. \n   \nOn another occasion, he said we can no longer go to his shop on Thursdays (It's the local store so we shop there regularly) because he'd told them he needed that day off as he takes me to therapy that day (This isn't true, we've never been to therapy)  \n\nMore recently we had similar incident, where he told me I couldn't go in the his shop as he'd used me as an excuse again. I Took another snoop and found he'd told them he needed to stay home with me due to my mental health. When he finally went back he told them that my brother is able to be with me now so he feels safe leaving me at home (I Haven't spoken to my brother in months)\n\nTo be clear, I have no history of mental health issues, never had to go to therapy, never been a missing person, nor has anyone ever had to call the police for me\n\nThis all also reminded me of a time a while ago, where he mentioned in casual conversation how he could get away with killing me, because no one would notice me missing. He explained how I don't talk to my friends or family regularly so they wouldn't realise I was gone, and he could just call my work and tell them I quit. This did creep me out at the time, but I brushed it off as a weird joke\n\nFor background, my husband is diagnosed with autism,  ADHD, and narcissistic personality disorder, he also has always had compulsive lying and anger issue. (I've Know of that since even before this) He also has a history of mistreating me, in a way some might call abusive. A lot of emotional abuse such as putting me down, both privately and in front of other,  being demanding and controling. He's never actually struck me physically, but has used threats of violence to get what he wants before\n\nAlthough all this concerns me, I also feel kinda silly for being concerned. Maybe I'm just paranoid, maybe I actually am as crazy as he's making me out to be? An outside perspective would be helpful.\n\nShould I do anything, or just ignore it and stop snooping?\n\nEDIT: Apologies for the way I've been replying to comments so far, I realise I've been acting kinda stubborn and it isn't helpful. I'm Gonna pause reading the comments for a bit so I can come back with a more clear head. Please do continue commenting if you have anything though as I will read them]",

            "Aswer": "Congratulations on continuing to make positive changes in your life and your family's life. \n\nA couple ideas of things that you could do: \n1. Make dinner together. Even if you can't cook and make only simple things, do you know how to make an ice cream sundae or make tacos together or make your own personal pizzas or nachos? Something where you get a chance to do an activity together. \n\n2. Go to Walmart (go with her) and pick out some arts and crafts supplies and draw pictures together. Even if you aren't good at art, doesn't matter, what matters is doing something together, maybe she takes your picture home and you keep hers. Or there are like craft kits for making little window/mirror decorations, just scrolling online there's like a paint your own unicorn, you could even give her a little sketchbook to draw in. Just stay away from things with small parts and beads and such. \n\n3. Does she have a designated place to sleep for her? Maybe you two can go pick out a blanket together that she keeps at your place, or stuffed animal, or pillow etc. Something that's hers for her sleeping spot to feel more comfortable. (sorry I'm thinking of a lot of purchasing ideas). \n\n4. Watch some movies together. Maybe some movies you liked as a kid if you have a streaming service that she hasn't seen before. Hell watch some star wars and make lightsabers out of cardboard boxes and such. \n\n5. If there's time when she visits and one near by, take her to the aquarium. They're excellent places. Also much better than the zoo. Maybe you go to the aquarium and afterwards you both draw your favorite fish that you saw while eating dinner? Or maybe you get her a little portable camera to take photos, or you let her take photos of the fish with your phone? \n\nProbably not the best ideas but hopefully inspire some other ones for you.

We buy food (mostly on weekends) if there\u2019s nothing at home and she said the money will go towards that or just anything that needs to be paid for. I realize now that I might have been a little misleading because I cannot confirm that I actually make $500.

I\u2019m not sure how old you are but I have many friends who smoked in high school and \u2018claim\u2019 negative side effects like bad memory loss etc. it\u2019s better to wait for your brain to fully develop. \n\nIf you do want to try it, start small. Don\u2019t get pressured into doing more than your comfortable and give yourself some time to feel the effects before continuing. I usually find with smoking that 10-20 minutes after the hit I can feel it. Edibles are different and can take 30 minutes to 1.5+ hours.\n\nDifferent types of weed have different effects. You may not like what you smoke, but it could be the strain. You can always try another one later.\n\nYou may get paranoid. Just remember that it won\u2019t kill you and take deep breaths. Be close to people you trust who can help keep you relaxed. A good environment means a good high.\n\nWeed can be a good way to relax and hang out with friends - like drinking can - but it can also help distress from a long day. Do what feels right for you but if you find yourself smoking from morning until night, or you feel a compulsion to smoke before every meal, consider taking a break.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: updated age to 25 per many recommendations. Personally I started at 20 as many do in college but I\u2019m sure medically the recommendation is 25. If it\u2019s occasional and small amounts I don\u2019t think there\u2019s significant side effects.\n\nEdit 2: as always anyone who is neurodivergent or has a mental illness should always be cautious about using substances. If you see a therapist or psychiatrist and feel comfortable with them try to be honest about your usage. It\u2019ll help them help you and may impact what medications they recommend.",

            "Question": "Is it normal to love your family but want to move far away and have nothing to do with them?\nI (23M) live with 2 parents and a younger brother. My parents are really great people and I love them to death. I would do almost anything for them if I they ever needed help, hope to financially support them if able and wish them the best in life. Same applies to my younger brother. However, I absolutely hate living together and being within touching distance where I have to interact and talk to them, or even see them for that matter. I would like to move as far away from them as possible and cut off frequent contact. I would not mind talking to them every once in a while to check up (once a month, let\u2019s say). And going to see them for a couple of days a year. I want to live a life completely separate from them in which they are not involved. Am I lying to myself by saying that I love them ? Can both of my feelings coexist ? I feel guilty for wanting what I want.\n\nEdit: Thank you for the kind replies everyone! Helps to know I\u2019m not actually a dick haha. I definitely agree with it being an autonomy thing. However, they come from a culture that is very interdependent family wise. That is probably why I felt like it\u2019s such a \u2018bad\u2019 thing to not want the same.",

A few months ago we recommended two married friends of ours who I will call Mark and Lisa for membership. We invited them for a meet and greet with other members one evening at an upscale lounge. \n\nLisa likes to dress very sexy and youthful. She is 60 years old, on the heavier side, and has very large breast implants that she can never seem to keep inside her clothes. She showed up to the evening wearing platform flip flops and a semi-see-through beach romper that left nothing to the imagination. When the evening was over, several members shared their feedback and gave her a hard \u201cno\u201d for membership. Some cited a \u201cpersonality conflict\u201d but others stated that they found her appearance and dress to be \u201ctrashy\u201d and \u201cinappropriate\u201d and \u201ccontradictory to the public persona our group is trying to establish.\u201d  Needless to say they did not become members. \n\nI love my friend. She is kind, funny, hardworking, and would give you the shirt off her back (no pun intended). I don\u2019t judge her for her clothing choices but I do feel uncomfortable sometimes when we hang out, husbands in tow, and she has yet another (entirely preventable) wardrobe malfunction. Do I tell her how wildly inappropriate this is?  Or do I bite my tongue and accept her and her fashion choices?  Thanks.",

Download it and take it outside maybe 75 feet from her car and refresh the app. Take note of all devices that it picks up. Then got next to the car and refresh the app, if there is a tracker in or on the car you'll notice a new device appearing in the app. Look at the distance which is in meters, then walk around to different sides of the car, and look at the distance. The lower the distance means the closer you are to the Air Tag. The app should display Air Tag so it should be really easy to find in the app when looking at it. I'd also recommend maybe doing this search with her car at least 75 feet from all other cars and bluetooth device that are on phones and cars. It should be super easy to find. Good luck and keep us posted on the progress. Here's a [link for the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ble-scanner-4-0/id1221763603).",
