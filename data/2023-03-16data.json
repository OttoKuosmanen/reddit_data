I don't know what to do. I'm in shock. He was the nicest person I'd ever met. We live together. We have been together for a little over a year. I feel like my life has imploded. We have an open phone policy because of how he broke my trust over a woman he used to be friends with, and my curiosity got the best of me, and I looked through his search history. How do I cope with this? I just.... I can't believe this is real. We talked and we both decided it was best he leave until I contact him again. How do I go from here?\n\nEdit:   I will be contacting the police. This all happened about 30-45 minutes before I made this post. I own my home, and he isn't on any of the paperwork as I bought it years before I met him. He does not have any keys. I have cameras on the property and will change the garage code. I am packing his things now for him to pick up tomorrow, and after that, he will be blocked on everything. I am going to seek therapy. I am still in shock. Thank you for all the replies, I will keep reading them.",

Eventually I got so frustrated that I grabbed my car keys and took off for no more than 10-15 minutes to calm down. I came back home and while things weren\u2019t exactly back to normal, kept to ourselves in seperate rooms for a few hours, calmed ourselves down and then talked it out.\nA few days later, I get a message from one her co-workers threatening me saying if I ever put my hands on her again, he was going to beat the crap out of me. I didn\u2019t say anything to my wife as I didn\u2019t want to get into argument so I ignored and deleted the message. Later that night while my wife was sleeping, I grabbed her phone and checked her messages (I know, not cool but I didn\u2019t know what else to do) where she said what happened but added in a new part where I grabbed her and pinned her up against the wall before I took off. She also said she\u2019s scared that eventually I\u2019m going to snap and hit her in a fit of rage. We\u2019ve had a few arguments but I have never once laid a finger on her during our entire time together.\nHow would be the best way to approach this with her without getting into a massive fight about it?

Yes, this is a serious question and not a troll even though it may sound like one. I know, it's weird. I've been addicted to masturbation, edging, and porn since I was 12 years old, and my addiction has never been worse than it is right now.\n\nTo break it all down for you, I typically edge to porn for around 10-12 hours a day, sleep for 4-6 hours a night, and then spend the remaining 6-8 hours of my day getting my priorities done (going to class, studying, and doing my homework). I'm still doing well in all of my college courses, and I enjoy learning and feeling successful by getting stellar grades. So at least that hasn't changed for me. \n\nBut besides that, I just masturbate for 10-12 hours a day and sleep for a little bit. I can't even remember the last time that I slept for more than seven hours in a single night. It's probably been around two months now. I wish that I could stop, but I don't really have a reason to at the same time. I don't have a girlfriend to make love with or anything. \n\nSo, how can I stop? At the end of the day, I do realize that this is really unhealthy and that I need to get rid of this addiction.",

At 7 years old she told me that our mother got pregnant with me as an accident so I was a mistake. At 12 years old, she stopped talking to me despite us living in the same home. So until I was 18 (when I had a chance to move out for school) my home life with her was a living hell. \n\nShe would throw out my dinner at times, leave me stranded out of the house for hours when I had forgotten my house keys, tell me I was worthless, humiliate me in front of my friends, mock me, call me obscene profanities, hide my things. She would judge every single action I would take and use it against me. She would reject and hate on me every single day. \nThe abuse got so bad that I spent every evening when I came home from school locked in my room just to avoid the abuse. \n\nMy parents knew she was mistreating me, and did nothing to stop it. If anything, they told me to just stay quiet, to avoid triggering her and to just ignore the abuse. I would ask them to do something about it but they just ignored my cries for help. \n\nEventually, after years of abuse I developed social anxiety and depression, and self esteem issues, all of which I\u2019m working to heal even to this day.\n\nFast forward to today. \nI live with my mother (71F) at the moment, and guess who came to visit last week for a week? My eldest sister.\n\nIt was hell again. She told me I was worthless again and started body-shaming me. Despite me standing up for myself, my mother kept telling me I should just stay quiet and not trigger her. \n\nSo when my sister left, I confronted my mother for continuing to enable these abusive dynamics, but she laughed it off saying I was being sensitive and that I should just move on.\nThat she didn\u2019t do anything about the abuse when I was younger because she was too busy working to feed\nand clothe us. That I should just be grateful because she loves me and had sacrificed so much for me.\n\nI don\u2019t think my sister will ever change as she is almost 50, and my mother doesn\u2019t take accountability for her role in enabling my sister\u2019s abuse. But it makes me so angry when she tells me that I am ungrateful daughter who should be more loving. \n\nMoving forward, what would be the best approach in dealing with my mother and sister? Would you consider their behaviour as toxic and abusive? Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated thank you",

            "Question": "I Think My Husband Could Be Plotting To Kill Me\nTL;DR Discovered my husband has for a while been telling people I'm suicidal, and am generally mentally unstable. It's occured to me this could be part of an attempt to make it look like I commited suicide if I were to die suddenly. Am I being paranoid?\n\nI (26f) Have recently found reason to suggest my husband (29M) could be plotting to kill me and make it look like a suicide.\n\nYes, I realise how out there that sound, let me explain-\n\nMy reason for thinking is is because I discovered he has been secretly telling people we know, for a while, that I am apparently suicidal, along with other things to make me seem mentally unstable, as far as lying about having to call the police because I was a missing person. Recently the thought came to my mind, that this could be a way of making my death appear like a suicide, if he were to kill me, and I wanna share those thoughts to see what others think \n\nIt started after he one night told me not to go into the local store he works at, as he left early and had apparently used me as an excuse. Then not long after he happened to leave his messages open, and I noticed a conversation with his coworker about me, so curiosity got the better and I took a snoop. Turns out the excuse he'd used about me, was claiming that I'd gone missing and he needed to go look for me, adding the detail that I'm 'on suicide watch' even saying that he called the police. \n   \nOn another occasion, he said we can no longer go to his shop on Thursdays (It's the local store so we shop there regularly) because he'd told them he needed that day off as he takes me to therapy that day (This isn't true, we've never been to therapy)  \n\nMore recently we had similar incident, where he told me I couldn't go in the his shop as he'd used me as an excuse again. I Took another snoop and found he'd told them he needed to stay home with me due to my mental health. When he finally went back he told them that my brother is able to be with me now so he feels safe leaving me at home (I Haven't spoken to my brother in months)\n\nTo be clear, I have no history of mental health issues, never had to go to therapy, never been a missing person, nor has anyone ever had to call the police for me\n\nThis all also reminded me of a time a while ago, where he mentioned in casual conversation how he could get away with killing me, because no one would notice me missing. He explained how I don't talk to my friends or family regularly so they wouldn't realise I was gone, and he could just call my work and tell them I quit. This did creep me out at the time, but I brushed it off as a weird joke\n\nFor background, my husband is diagnosed with autism,  ADHD, and narcissistic personality disorder, he also has always had compulsive lying and anger issue. (I've Know of that since even before this) He also has a history of mistreating me, in a way some might call abusive. A lot of emotional abuse such as putting me down, both privately and in front of other,  being demanding and controling. He's never actually struck me physically, but has used threats of violence to get what he wants before\n\nAlthough all this concerns me, I also feel kinda silly for being concerned. Maybe I'm just paranoid, maybe I actually am as crazy as he's making me out to be? An outside perspective would be helpful.\n\nShould I do anything, or just ignore it and stop snooping?\n\nEDIT: Apologies for the way I've been replying to comments so far, I realise I've been acting kinda stubborn and it isn't helpful. I'm Gonna pause reading the comments for a bit so I can come back with a more clear head. Please do continue commenting if you have anything though as I will read them]",

I\u2019ve been clean 2 years, and after a years worth of supervised visits I finally get to bring her home for a sleepover. Any advice? I\u2019m so freaking nervous, I\u2019m still new to this whole dad stuff, but I want it to be fun and go smooth. I don\u2019t want her to feel like Im a stranger or she\u2019s a guest in my house. What do we do all night? Movies, games? I have a PlayStation. We\u2019ve had some unsupervised visits which just concluded of us going to McDonald\u2019s or Wendy\u2019s or to the park or beach. I just would like to get to know her and her to know me. I don\u2019t want to mess this up, or make it boring and her not want to come back. I want to be the dad she deserves. Advice?",

            "Aswer": "Congratulations on continuing to make positive changes in your life and your family's life. \n\nA couple ideas of things that you could do: \n1. Make dinner together. Even if you can't cook and make only simple things, do you know how to make an ice cream sundae or make tacos together or make your own personal pizzas or nachos? Something where you get a chance to do an activity together. \n\n2. Go to Walmart (go with her) and pick out some arts and crafts supplies and draw pictures together. Even if you aren't good at art, doesn't matter, what matters is doing something together, maybe she takes your picture home and you keep hers. Or there are like craft kits for making little window/mirror decorations, just scrolling online there's like a paint your own unicorn, you could even give her a little sketchbook to draw in. Just stay away from things with small parts and beads and such. \n\n3. Does she have a designated place to sleep for her? Maybe you two can go pick out a blanket together that she keeps at your place, or stuffed animal, or pillow etc. Something that's hers for her sleeping spot to feel more comfortable. (sorry I'm thinking of a lot of purchasing ideas). \n\n4. Watch some movies together. Maybe some movies you liked as a kid if you have a streaming service that she hasn't seen before. Hell watch some star wars and make lightsabers out of cardboard boxes and such. \n\n5. If there's time when she visits and one near by, take her to the aquarium. They're excellent places. Also much better than the zoo. Maybe you go to the aquarium and afterwards you both draw your favorite fish that you saw while eating dinner? Or maybe you get her a little portable camera to take photos, or you let her take photos of the fish with your phone? \n\nProbably not the best ideas but hopefully inspire some other ones for you. Again congratulations on the progress in your life and good luck.",

            "Question": "My mom wants me to contribute money for bills and I need advice\nI (15F) recently started interning in my school. I am in the planning committee and help with all the school events. I stay after-school for two hours on Mondays and Tuesdays to help one of my teachers (i help with things like organizing, printing papers, small things like that) My mom (35F) is asking me to contribute $50 to help with bills. I get paid $500 every two weeks. I do want to contribute, but I don\u2019t know if nows the right time to. Should I contribute? Or should I tell her no and wait until I get a higher paying job when I\u2019m older.\n\nEdit: Hello, I just woke up. Thank you for all the advice. Yesterday I asked my mom what the $50 was for and she said it was for if we ever needed it. We buy food (mostly on weekends) if there\u2019s nothing at home and she said the money will go towards that or just anything that needs to be paid for. I realize now that I might have been a little misleading because I cannot confirm that I actually make $500. The coordinator of the program I\u2019m in said we make $500 every two weeks, but I get my first check on Friday. I also said I was an intern, sorry about that I just checked my timesheet and it says im a teacher aide.",

We get along well, but she tends to be reckless about many things and having to be saved by my grandfather. My grandfather is a very responsible person though he is a very serious one because he didn't really have time to be a teen because his father died early so he had to \"be the man of the house\" since he was 15 years old. \n\nMy mother recently said she wanted to start practicing another career (she hasn't worked for a while) , and that's okay because it's never late in life to find your passion. The problem is that she has started an account on social media advertising herself as having that title which is illegal. She has already been told to not do it by my grandpa, but because he is so serious she has become very hostile and evasive with him. And in the recent years the same attitude towards myself because I have called her out on a lot of stuff. \n\nShe is a good woman but is emotionally unstable because of past events and a really good mother in the many hardships me or my siblings have had. Now I don't know what to do because if she gets any clue that I'm involved she will not do it out of spite. \n\nI just want to help her because someone that doesn't like her finds out and files a complaint which will result in an arrest.

            "Aswer": "It\u2019s a very personal choice that no one here can make for you. But if you\u2019re asking strangers then you may either feel pressured (directly or indirectly) by your friends or you are slightly interested but nervous. It\u2019s not a hard drug - you won\u2019t get physically or mentally hooked after a couple of hits. But it can be habit forming and many people get sucked into it that way.\n\nWe\u2019ll speak only recreationally because medical is a whole other topic. First, I\u2019d personally recommend not smoking before 25. I\u2019m not sure how old you are but I have many friends who smoked in high school and \u2018claim\u2019 negative side effects like bad memory loss etc. it\u2019s better to wait for your brain to fully develop. \n\nIf you do want to try it, start small. Don\u2019t get pressured into doing more than your comfortable and give yourself some time to feel the effects before continuing. I usually find with smoking that 10-20 minutes after the hit I can feel it. Edibles are different and can take 30 minutes to 1.5+ hours.\n\nDifferent types of weed have different effects. You may not like what you smoke, but it could be the strain. You can always try another one later.\n\nYou may get paranoid. Just remember that it won\u2019t kill you and take deep breaths. Be close to people you trust who can help keep you relaxed. A good environment means a good high.\n\nWeed can be a good way to relax and hang out with friends - like drinking can - but it can also help distress from a long day. Do what feels right for you but if you find yourself smoking from morning until night, or you feel a compulsion to smoke before every meal, consider taking a break.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: updated age to 25 per many recommendations. Personally I started at 20 as many do in college but I\u2019m sure medically the recommendation is 25. If it\u2019s occasional and small amounts I don\u2019t think there\u2019s significant side effects.\n\nEdit 2: as always anyone who is neurodivergent or has a mental illness should always be cautious about using substances. If you see a therapist or psychiatrist and feel comfortable with them try to be honest about your usage. It\u2019ll help them help you and may impact what medications they recommend.",
