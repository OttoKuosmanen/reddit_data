            "Question": "A delusional teenager I work with is telling people we're dating\nAlright! So I don't know what to do about any of this. I (20F) am a server at a local restaurant. I have a decent amount of underage coworkers that I'm always nice to because I remember what it was like to be a teenager around adults who hated me. However, this one busser (16M) has gotten some sort of delusion in his head that we're dating, and I'm worried it's going to ruin my life.\n\nI've heard from coworkers who are my age AND who are his age and go to school with him that he's been saying we've had sex, I've performed sexual acts on him, and that my long-term partner who I talk frequently about at work is a cover story. Apparently he's said these things both at work (less of the lewd rumors) and at school CONSTANTLY.\n\nI've spoken to him about this, I've spoken to my managers (unfortunately they can't schedule me around him, against corporate rules.) Every single time someone mentions these rumours I vehemently disspell them, but it's all just getting worse and I'm afraid he's going to absolutely ruin my life.\n\nUnfortunately quitting isn't an option as this is the only place I can work with my school schedule, and I've gone as far as threatening legal action. I'm at a loss as to what to do to make these rumours stop besides finding a way to contact his parents and begging them to get him help. What do I do?! I'm constantly on the verge of a panic attack...",

I've had friends before when I was in my early 20s, but I had a falling out with many of them, and the overall number of friends I had were minimal at best. I'm now in my late 20s and left with but a single friend with no idea how to find more. I'm not invited to parties anymore as I was in my teens/early 20s since my peers now have families and careers. Also, I'd feel awkward going to a party thrown by early 20s. \n\nI feel that it might be my attitude that is off-putting to people. I don't know why, I always try to uplift everyone around me, and im kind and respectful. Though it's true that I can be rather sassy often. I suppose the main inhibito of my attitude is my depression, which actually dampens my mood and, therefore, my attitude considerably. My life sucks. That's just how I feel. I don't really go out there displaying this attitude to everyone, but I guess maybe people feel the energy when they're around me?",

We are now both in our late 40s.  I have had chronic pain, chronic migraines, infertility, and mental health issues mostly starting after that accident.  \nMy sister and I do not have a good relationship.  My sister is not a nice person and has kept her kids away from me because of family drama.  This has broken my heart.

I could deal with my grief by hating my other brother for taking the person I love away from me.

            "Question": "Food randomly disappearing from my house, need advice.\nI've been experiencing a strange problem lately and I'm hoping to get some advice on how to deal with it. For the past few weeks, I've noticed that food in my house has been disappearing without any explanation. At first, I thought I was just forgetful and had eaten it myself, but I've started keeping track and now I'm sure that something else is going on.\n\nThe food that's been disappearing is usually things like snacks, fruits, and other small items that can be easily grabbed and eaten. It's never anything substantial like a full meal, but it's enough to be noticeable. I live alone, so it's not like anyone else is eating it without my knowledge and there aren't any extra wrappers or peels in any of my trash cans or bags.\n\nI've checked my apartment for any signs of a break-in, but everything seems to be in order. I've also considering asking my neighbours if they've noticed anything suspicious, but I haven't yet\n\nI'm starting to feel paranoid and I'm not sure what to do. Has anyone else experienced something like this?\n\nQuick Edits: Don't want to divulge much information about myself, but I'm 20, I'm Brazilian, the apartment is owned by parents while I study in my university and they will sell it back once I'm done. Nobody has any keys and my parents added a tetra key lock (I believe that's the name) when they bought the place.\n\n\n Currently taking the following advice:\n*Taking pictures of the kitchen and other areas to compare while I'm away from home.\n*I'm going to talk to the janitor today, hopefully she'll be of help.\n*Slept with my leg tied up to the bed frame and I believe that's enough proof that I'm not sleepwalking, but I can't be sure.\n*Windows are now closed. Just leaving my bedroom's window open so I can get some air and I can keep an eye on it constantly.",

            "Question": "I\u2019m having doubts on if my daughter is biologically mine and don\u2019t know if I should take a paternity test and risk my marriage..\nI\u2019m new to Reddit but I\u2019m currently in a tough place and need an outside perspective. \n\nMe and my wife of 3 years have a baby girl she\u2019s 2. They\u2019re my world and honestly I\u2019ve been beating myself up even having these thoughts but recently I\u2019ve doubted if she\u2019s really my biological daughter. We have similarities but there are certain things that have me second guessing. My wife and I both have green eyes I\u2019m mixed and she\u2019s Italian and American. My baby has brown eyes I know it\u2019s a possible for two green eyed parents to have a brown eyed baby but I\u2019ve read it\u2019s rare. \n\nA few years back I had to travel for work and I had my suspicions of my wife cheating but the thought alone brought me to tears. I discussed it with her and she assured me she was loyal to me. She has cheated in her previous relationship but I didn\u2019t want to judge based on that because she was in high school and we\u2019ve all done dumb shit we regret as kids. \n\nI have discussed my concerns with her and to say I caused an argument would be an understatement. She got extremely upset and asked me how I could insinuate that she would ever cheat on me or that my baby isn\u2019t mine. I\u2019ve spoken to her in the past ab my doubts and she told me she would never cheat. I brought it up again and said I had my doubts but I\u2019ll drop it and apologized. She got very defensive and started crying saying \u201cI guess you want a paternity test since you don\u2019t believe me\u201d. I said no but after speaking with my family about it I think I may want one just to clear my mind. If she\u2019s mine I\u2019ll hate myself for ever being doubtful but if she\u2019s not I still haven\u2019t thought about the consequences that can bring. She is my daughter and I love her no matter what but what will that do to my marriage. \n\nThis has caused me so much internal conflict and I\u2019ve spent nights crying thinking I could be making the biggest mistake of my life. If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation from mine or my wife\u2019s perspective it would be greatly appreciated.",

The longer our mini-separation continued, the angrier my parents got at me.\n\nWe got back together after about a week apart.\n\nI feel like I was pressured into it.

I was arrested and I was almost sent to jail. Even when I was forced to come out of the closet to my super religious family who disowned me in a heartbeat and, it was revealed that I had both testicles removed due to cancer at 14 it wasn't until the girl admitted to lying about the whole thing even the pregnancy all because, her best friend dared her too, that the case was dropped, but the damaged was done. School had expelled me, my family disowned me, I thrown me out of the house, I lost my part-time job. I did sue her but, I didn't get much. I did get enough so I was able to move to another state. I was in a really bad place mentally for years over what happened to me, and I'm still not over it.\n\nI met my boyfriend at work. He was very low contact with his parents, only texting happy birthday/merry Christmas. I knew he had a sister but he was no contact with her at all. I did ask but, it was obviously a touchy subject so I never prodded to deep on the subject but I just assumed it was like similar to my family situation. Last night I finally feet comfortable about talking about what happened to me. It wasn't hard to put two and two and, he realised that it was his sister and what his sister did to me is why he's low-no contact with his family. He was away at university, when this happened. I don't know what to do I've already started to fall for him, god dam it. Idon't want that bitch to ruin another thing for me but, is this to weird?",

Yes, this is a serious question and not a troll even though it may sound like one. I know, it's weird. I've been addicted to masturbation, edging, and porn since I was 12 years old, and my addiction has never been worse than it is right now.\n\nTo break it all down for you, I typically edge to porn for around 10-12 hours a day, sleep for 4-6 hours a night, and then spend the remaining 6-8 hours of my day getting my priorities done (going to class, studying, and doing my homework). I'm still doing well in all of my college courses, and I enjoy learning and feeling successful by getting stellar grades. So at least that hasn't changed for me. \n\nBut besides that, I just masturbate for 10-12 hours a day and sleep for a little bit. I can't even remember the last time that I slept for more than seven hours in a single night. It's probably been around two months now. I wish that I could stop, but I don't really have a reason to at the same time. I don't have a girlfriend to make love with or anything. \n\nSo, how can I stop? At the end of the day, I do realize that this is really unhealthy and that I need to get rid of this addiction.",

            "Question": "My toxic family thinks that I am the problem\nAnd by family, I mean my sister and mother.\n\nHi, I, (32F) think I\u2019ve reached a limit in believing my family will ever be anything close to healthy/functional.\n\nAs a child, I always perceived my eldest sister who is almost 20 years older, as abusive. At 7 years old she told me that our mother got pregnant with me as an accident so I was a mistake. At 12 years old, she stopped talking to me despite us living in the same home. So until I was 18 (when I had a chance to move out for school) my home life with her was a living hell. \n\nShe would throw out my dinner at times, leave me stranded out of the house for hours when I had forgotten my house keys, tell me I was worthless, humiliate me in front of my friends, mock me, call me obscene profanities, hide my things. She would judge every single action I would take and use it against me. She would reject and hate on me every single day. \nThe abuse got so bad that I spent every evening when I came home from school locked in my room just to avoid the abuse. \n\nMy parents knew she was mistreating me, and did nothing to stop it. If anything, they told me to just stay quiet, to avoid triggering her and to just ignore the abuse. I would ask them to do something about it but they just ignored my cries for help. \n\nEventually, after years of abuse I developed social anxiety and depression, and self esteem issues, all of which I\u2019m working to heal even to this day.\n\nFast forward to today. \nI live with my mother (71F) at the moment, and guess who came to visit last week for a week? My eldest sister.\n\nIt was hell again. She told me I was worthless again and started body-shaming me. Despite me standing up for myself, my mother kept telling me I should just stay quiet and not trigger her. \n\nSo when my sister left, I confronted my mother for continuing to enable these abusive dynamics, but she laughed it off saying I was being sensitive and that I should just move on.\nThat she didn\u2019t do anything about the abuse when I was younger because she was too busy working to feed\nand clothe us. That I should just be grateful because she loves me and had sacrificed so much for me.\n\nI don\u2019t think my sister will ever change as she is almost 50, and my mother doesn\u2019t take accountability for her role in enabling my sister\u2019s abuse. But it makes me so angry when she tells me that I am ungrateful daughter who should be more loving. \n\nMoving forward, what would be the best approach in dealing with my mother and sister? Would you consider their behaviour as toxic and abusive? Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated thank you",

            "Question": "I Think My Husband Could Be Plotting To Kill Me\nTL;DR Discovered my husband has for a while been telling people I'm suicidal, and am generally mentally unstable. It's occured to me this could be part of an attempt to make it look like I commited suicide if I were to die suddenly. Am I being paranoid?\n\nI (26f) Have recently found reason to suggest my husband (29M) could be plotting to kill me and make it look like a suicide.\n\nYes, I realise how out there that sound, let me explain-\n\nMy reason for thinking is is because I discovered he has been secretly telling people we know, for a while, that I am apparently suicidal, along with other things to make me seem mentally unstable, as far as lying about having to call the police because I was a missing person. Recently the thought came to my mind, that this could be a way of making my death appear like a suicide, if he were to kill me, and I wanna share those thoughts to see what others think \n\nIt started after he one night told me not to go into the local store he works at, as he left early and had apparently used me as an excuse. Then not long after he happened to leave his messages open, and I noticed a conversation with his coworker about me, so curiosity got the better and I took a snoop. Turns out the excuse he'd used about me, was claiming that I'd gone missing and he needed to go look for me, adding the detail that I'm 'on suicide watch' even saying that he called the police. \n   \nOn another occasion, he said we can no longer go to his shop on Thursdays (It's the local store so we shop there regularly) because he'd told them he needed that day off as he takes me to therapy that day (This isn't true, we've never been to therapy)  \n\nMore recently we had similar incident, where he told me I couldn't go in the his shop as he'd used me as an excuse again. I Took another snoop and found he'd told them he needed to stay home with me due to my mental health. When he finally went back he told them that my brother is able to be with me now so he feels safe leaving me at home (I Haven't spoken to my brother in months)\n\nTo be clear, I have no history of mental health issues, never had to go to therapy, never been a missing person, nor has anyone ever had to call the police for me\n\nThis all also reminded me of a time a while ago, where he mentioned in casual conversation how he could get away with killing me, because no one would notice me missing. He explained how I don't talk to my friends or family regularly so they wouldn't realise I was gone, and he could just call my work and tell them I quit. This did creep me out at the time, but I brushed it off as a weird joke\n\nFor background, my husband is diagnosed with autism,  ADHD, and narcissistic personality disorder, he also has always had compulsive lying and anger issue. (I've Know of that since even before this) He also has a history of mistreating me, in a way some might call abusive. A lot of emotional abuse such as putting me down, both privately and in front of other,  being demanding and controling. He's never actually struck me physically, but has used threats of violence to get what he wants before\n\nAlthough all this concerns me, I also feel kinda silly for being concerned. Maybe I'm just paranoid, maybe I actually am as crazy as he's making me out to be? An outside perspective would be helpful.\n\nShould I do anything, or just ignore it and stop snooping?\n\nEDIT: Apologies for the way I've been replying to comments so far, I realise I've been acting kinda stubborn and it isn't helpful. I'm Gonna pause reading the comments for a bit so I can come back with a more clear head. Please do continue commenting if you have anything though as I will read them]",
