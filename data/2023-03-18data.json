            "Question": "I slept with my female friend even though I am gay. I don't know what else to do.\nI don't know where to start. It is a massive fuck up from my part. For starters, I (30M) was in a relationship with my boyfriend John (30M) for 7 years. I found out he was having an affair with a married man (34M). I got to know because that married man's wife, Kelly (32F) showed up to my place to talk to my boyfriend but he wasn't there at that time. That's when she informed me that my boyfriend and her husband has been having an affair for 3 years. The woman just cried in front of me. And we both confronted each other's significant others. I broke up with John and Kelly got a divorce. Over the last 3 years Kelly and I have started to talk. At first she approached me by saying a lot of her family and friends are against her because she is not happy with her husband coming out and even calling her homophobic. I explained to her that she wasn't homophobic. It is justifiable for her to feel hurt over this. \n\nShe is a nice and kind woman. I liked her. I liked spending time with her. Her friends have also became my friends. She and I helped each other through our tough times. Over the last 3 years we have been in and out of relationships with other people. Last night she called me and said she is alone because that day was her anniversary. I asked her if she needed me to be there, she told me yes if I don't mind. I went there. We were lying on her bed and kinda tipsy from all the alcohol. We were talking and she said how much she feels alone and humiliated by her ex-husband. I said I understand. Then she snuggled closer to me and kissed me. She immediately stopped and said sorry multiple times. I just brushed it off and said it's fine we are just tipsy. The next time I kissed her and one thing led to another we had sex. And it was not like I hated it or repulsed by her. In fact we did it 2 more times before falling asleep. The next morning we talked. She says that she understands that I am going through some stuff and said sorry if I ever felt forced. I told her no, it was consented. I left her place. I don't know what happened to me. I knew I was gay since I was 18. But I did like sleeping with her. I don't know. Maybe I need to rethink my life choices. Is this something normal?",

            "Question": "UPDATE: I\u2019m having doubts on if my daughter is biologically mine and don\u2019t know if I should do a paternity test and risk my marriage.\n[original post]\n(https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11t7w2x/im_having_doubts_on_if_my_daughter_is/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=1&utm_term=1)\n\nI don\u2019t know if this is the right way to make an update post i did make an edit on my original post as well. \nI wasn\u2019t expecting to make this update especially the day after. \n\nThis conversation with my wife isn\u2019t new. But from the point where I made the comment she\u2019s been very cold and threatening our marriage saying I better not get the test done behind her back and she also would not allow it to happen at all. I read comments from a lot of women saying they\u2019d be pissed too either way if the test positive or negative from mistrust, so I thought that was the case. We did have a long conversation this morning. She looked through my phone last night and found the post. That\u2019s what sparked the conversation again. She said she was hurt I would keep bringing this up and I should trust her and leave my insecurities behind. \n\nIt was long conversation, a lot of tears and words were said. I offered marriage counseling and dropped the topic of the dna test. She refused and said it\u2019s ridiculous and doesn\u2019t want to involve anyone else in our marriage. \n\nI read a lot of comments and stories saying sometimes the guilt will get to them and they\u2019ll just confess without needing to do a test\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that would happen in my case but it did. She told me that she didn\u2019t want this to happen but she did cheat on me and my daughter is not mine. She said she wanted me to be the father and loved me and thought this would be her best option. She didn\u2019t want me to take a test and find out on my own which I wish she would\u2019ve come clean way before. I didn\u2019t know how to respond but asked who the father was because my mind already is making a million assumptions. She didn\u2019t tell me and began crying more telling me to not hate her and not end the marriage. I didn\u2019t say anything again waiting for an answer. This happened early this morning and I didn\u2019t an answer until this afternoon. \n\nI had to leave for work this morning so when I came back she had calmed down a bit and was ready to tell me. Her answer was probably the last thing I was expecting. She cried while saying this but said a few years back when I went on a business trip, she slept with my father who she \u201cran into on a drunk night\u201d I don\u2019t believe it. My father passed away in December from a colon cancer when he was 45. He did meet my daughter, half sister, his daughter idk.. but never said anything clearly. She said they both decided it was a dumb mistake (a major understatement) and it\u2019d be best to erase it and play me as being the father. Me and my father never had the best relationship I grew up with my single mom but he was present in my life and when he passed it hurt my family a  lot. So hearing this broke me. I am currently staying with my brother. I haven\u2019t spoken about what I\u2019ve learned with anyone even him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed so coming here to write this felt like a good place to get my thoughts out. \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything after she told me that and just left after she finished explaining. I don\u2019t know where I even go from here. I don\u2019t want to abandon my child while she\u2019s technically my half sister but do need time to process this. I don\u2019t think any amount of marriage therapy will fix this so divorce is my next step. I am going to seek a therapist for myself and help myself so I can be there for my daughter.",

So I consulted with a family friend who is a lawyer and IF THIS GETS OUT I CANNOT BE ARRESTED!! My state has odd statutory rape laws that DO NOT apply in this case. HOWEVER there is still the case of a hostile work environment! He recommended going to the manager once more and explaining the true weight of the situation, and told me to go to HR if they do nothing. He also said to try to find a way to contact his parents in an attempt to let them know that he needs serious help. Thank you so much for all the advice and for helping me relax bout a situation that is fairly easily taken care of!! I'll update again if anything else happens\n\nAlright! So I don't know what to do about any of this. I (20F) am a server at a local restaurant. I have a decent amount of underage coworkers that I'm always nice to because I remember what it was like to be a teenager around adults who hated me. However, this one busser (16M) has gotten some sort of delusion in his head that we're dating, and I'm worried it's going to ruin my life.\n\nI've heard from coworkers who are my age AND who are his age and go to school with him that he's been saying we've had sex, I've performed sexual acts on him, and that my long-term partner who I talk frequently about at work is a cover story. Apparently he's said these things both at work (less of the lewd rumors) and at school CONSTANTLY.\n\nI've spoken to him about this, I've spoken to my managers (unfortunately they can't schedule me around him, against corporate rules.) Every single time someone mentions these rumours I vehemently disspell them, but it's all just getting worse and I'm afraid he's going to absolutely ruin my life.\n\nUnfortunately quitting isn't an option as this is the only place I can work with my school schedule, and I've gone as far as threatening legal action. I'm at a loss as to what to do to make these rumours stop besides finding a way to contact his parents and begging them to get him help. What do I do?!

Things have been rough for us both personally, but our relationship has been good together for the most part.\n\nToday, out of the blue, I woke up to a long message about how she doesn't like me following other girls on Instagram (mind you, these are girls I've met once or twice either at EDM festivals, just out and about, struck up a conversation once or twice and or mutuals. I've never had anything romantic with them and I have no intentions on hitting them up/cheating on my girlfriend.). This was a recurring topic for a while that died down for a very long time, but just came up again. I told her I never talk to these girls online really, and I never check their pages, their feeds, etc and that there's nothing to worry about. I'm hardly even much of a media person outside of YouTube. I know she has problems with guys following models, but I don't do that. So I said that I don't want her to be controlling towards me because I'm never that way with her, and I'm not okay with her if she gives me this ultimatum when I've done so much for her to try to ease her anxiety and prove to her that I love her. (BTW she is posted on my Instagram so other girls would know I have a girlfriend anyway)\n\nShe says that me being reluctant to unfollow them shows I value them more than I value my relationship with her and that me following other girls gives her the ick. But for me, it's not about her telling me to unfollow specific people -- for me, it's about upholding my standards and establishing what trust means and not letting other people tell me how to manage my social media, etc. I have no problem unfollowing these people, but I think it points to larger red flags if she feels this way simply about me following these girls I don't interact with at all.\n\nAm I in the wrong for not unfollowing these girls I don't interact with on Insta because my girlfriend wants me to? Should I just leave?",

If she isn\u2019t willing to trust you and to begin to self love it will be impossible for her to maintain a healthy relationship with you or anyone else.

As I was recently invited to such an event, I realized I don't really own a lot of \"\"appropriate\"\" attire and don't really know how to style my hijab and outfit to look stylish but modest.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nWhile the internet helped me come up with a few ideas that might help other Muslim women who are in a similar situation, I'm hoping to hear from women on this sub, especially Muslim.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nOne idea I liked is a long, flowing maxi dress in a luxurious fabric such as silk or chiffon, paired with a coordinating hijab in a complementary color (and adding some sparkly accessories). Another is to wear a formal suit or dress pants with a blazer and blouse, again in luxurious fabrics such as silk or satin. A turban-style hijab (or even a simple hijab) with a fancy brooch should also add some elegance.\n\n&#x200B;\n\nI've also found inspiration from other Muslim women online who share their outfit ideas and styling tips. Many Muslim fashion bloggers and influencers have Instagram pages or YouTube channels where they share their latest looks and outfit ideas, and I'm increasingly falling in love with the designs from [Abaya](https://www.amanis.co.uk/).\n\n&#x200B;\n\nFinally, are there specific online retailers that cater to Muslim fashion you girls use more than others? And how do they balance fashion and modesty when selecting their outfits?\n\n&#x200B;\n\nTL;DR: I would love to hear other Muslim women's experiences with dressing for formal events. I would really love to feel \"\"stylish\"\" while also honoring my family's cultural traditions. Any tips or advice would be greatly appreciated!",

            "Question": "I\u2019m having doubts on if my daughter is biologically mine and don\u2019t know if I should take a paternity test and risk my marriage..\nI\u2019m new to Reddit but I\u2019m currently in a tough place and need an outside perspective. \n\nMe and my wife of 3 years have a baby girl she\u2019s 2. They\u2019re my world and honestly I\u2019ve been beating myself up even having these thoughts but recently I\u2019ve doubted if she\u2019s really my biological daughter. We have similarities but there are certain things that have me second guessing. My wife and I both have green eyes I\u2019m mixed and she\u2019s Italian and American. My baby has brown eyes I know it\u2019s a possible for two green eyed parents to have a brown eyed baby but I\u2019ve read it\u2019s rare. \n\nA few years back I had to travel for work and I had my suspicions of my wife cheating but the thought alone brought me to tears. I discussed it with her and she assured me she was loyal to me. She has cheated in her previous relationship but I didn\u2019t want to judge based on that because she was in high school and we\u2019ve all done dumb shit we regret as kids. \n\nI have discussed my concerns with her and to say I caused an argument would be an understatement. She got extremely upset and asked me how I could insinuate that she would ever cheat on me or that my baby isn\u2019t mine. I\u2019ve spoken to her in the past ab my doubts and she told me she would never cheat. I brought it up again and said I had my doubts but I\u2019ll drop it and apologized. She got very defensive and started crying saying \u201cI guess you want a paternity test since you don\u2019t believe me\u201d. I said no but after speaking with my family about it I think I may want one just to clear my mind. If she\u2019s mine I\u2019ll hate myself for ever being doubtful but if she\u2019s not I still haven\u2019t thought about the consequences that can bring. She is my daughter and I love her no matter what but what will that do to my marriage. \n\nThis has caused me so much internal conflict and I\u2019ve spent nights crying thinking I could be making the biggest mistake of my life. If anyone has any advice or has been in a similar situation from mine or my wife\u2019s perspective it would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEdit/Update: \nI was going to make an update post but don\u2019t know how so I hope this works.\nI wasn\u2019t expecting to make this update especially the day after. \n\nThis conversation with my wife isn\u2019t new. But from the point where I made the comment she\u2019s been very cold and threatening our marriage saying I better not get the test done behind her back and she also would not allow it to happen at all. I read comments from a lot of women saying they\u2019d be pissed too either way if the test positive or negative from mistrust, so I thought that was the case. We did have a long conversation this morning. She looked through my phone last night and found the post. That\u2019s what sparked the conversation again. She said she was hurt I would keep bringing this up and I should trust her and leave my insecurities behind. \n\nIt was long conversation, a lot of tears and words were said. I offered marriage counseling and dropped the topic of the dna test. She refused and said it\u2019s ridiculous and doesn\u2019t want to involve anyone else in our marriage. \n\nI read a lot of comments and stories saying sometimes the guilt will get to them and they\u2019ll just confess without needing to do a test\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that would happen in my case but it did. She told me that she didn\u2019t want this to happen but she did cheat on me and my daughter is not mine. She said she wanted me to be the father and loved me and thought this would be her best option. She didn\u2019t want me to take a test and find out on my own which I wish she would\u2019ve come clean way before. I didn\u2019t know how to respond but asked who the father was because my mind already is making a million assumptions. She didn\u2019t tell me and began crying more telling me to not hate her and not end the marriage. I didn\u2019t say anything again waiting for an answer. This happened early this morning and I didn\u2019t an answer until this afternoon. \n\nI had to leave for work this morning so when I came back she had calmed down a bit and was ready to tell me. Her answer was probably the last thing I was expecting. She cried while saying this but said a few years back when I went on a business trip, she slept with my father who she \u201cran into on a drunk night\u201d I don\u2019t believe it. My father passed away in December from a colon cancer when he was 45. He did meet my daughter, half sister, his daughter idk.. but never said anything clearly. She said they both decided it was a dumb mistake (a major understatement) and it\u2019d be best to erase it and play me as being the father. Me and my father never had the best relationship I grew up with my single mom but he was present in my life and when he passed it hurt my family a  lot. So hearing this broke me. I am currently staying with my brother. I haven\u2019t spoken about what I\u2019ve learned with anyone even him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed so coming here to write this felt like a good place to get my thoughts out. \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything after she told me that and just left after she finished explaining. I don\u2019t know where I even go from here. I don\u2019t want to abandon my child while she\u2019s technically my half sister but do need time to process this. I don\u2019t think any amount of marriage therapy will fix this so divorce is my next step. I am going to seek a therapist for myself and help myself so I can be there for my daughter.",

            "Aswer": "Okay, my advice? Take 3 steps back!\n\nI understand your doubts, the might be valid but when focusing on just eye color you have about a 25% change of that happening (a lot of other factors come in but it's a ballpark) that's the same as flipping heads twice in a row... Happens all the time!\n\nFirst: Before you do anything decide what you would do if the child isn't yours. Are you actually leaving? Or would you stay regardless?\n\nThere was a story on Reddit lately from a MIL that did the testing for the couple and it broke the guys heart because it was a SA baby and he really didn't want to know so he could keep pretending it was his. \n\nIf you stay regardless I can imagine it being worse if you would know she isn't yours. \n\nLeaving would be a valid choice, let's get that clear. However you need to decide before you do the test what the results will mean for you, because knowing may hurt you more than not knowing.\n\nSecond: get couples counseling, recently heard a story where after a good talk through a therapist both partners were on the same page (and got the test). Where your feelings are valid so are your wife's feelings. And finding a middle ground while both coming from a place of hurt is (almost) impossible. \n\nThird: if you really can't live without knowing and you can't find middle ground on this test, your relationship is already over. You will either resent yourself for not pushing, your partner for not agreeing or she will resent you for doing it anyway. Resentment is a top indicator (iirc even the number 1 indicator) for a failing relationship. Realize NOW if you really need that resentment in your life (in whatever shape) and act accordingly. \n\nBut, if you are ending the relationship anyway, might as well get the test through a court before paying child support.",

            "Question": "Food randomly disappearing from my house, need advice.\nI've been experiencing a strange problem lately and I'm hoping to get some advice on how to deal with it. For the past few weeks, I've noticed that food in my house has been disappearing without any explanation. At first, I thought I was just forgetful and had eaten it myself, but I've started keeping track and now I'm sure that something else is going on.\n\nThe food that's been disappearing is usually things like snacks, fruits, and other small items that can be easily grabbed and eaten. It's never anything substantial like a full meal, but it's enough to be noticeable. I live alone, so it's not like anyone else is eating it without my knowledge and there aren't any extra wrappers or peels in any of my trash cans or bags.\n\nI've checked my apartment for any signs of a break-in, but everything seems to be in order. I've also considering asking my neighbours if they've noticed anything suspicious, but I haven't yet\n\nI'm starting to feel paranoid and I'm not sure what to do. Has anyone else experienced something like this?\n\nQuick Edits: Don't want to divulge much information about myself, but I'm 20, I'm Brazilian, the apartment is owned by parents while I study in my university and they will sell it back once I'm done. Nobody has any keys and my parents added a tetra key lock (I believe that's the name) when they bought the place.\n\n\n Currently taking the following advice:\n*Taking pictures of the kitchen and other areas to compare while I'm away from home.\n*I'm going to talk to the janitor today, hopefully she'll be of help.\n*Slept with my leg tied up to the bed frame and I believe that's enough proof that I'm not sleepwalking, but I can't be sure.\n*Windows are now closed. Just leaving my bedroom's window open so I can get some air and I can keep an eye on it constantly.",

            "Question": "How do I tell my coworker to stop bothering me every single time I'm on my break trying to eat?\nTitle. I have extreme anxiety being seen eating and I always pick a time slot for my break that nobody else claims. Everyone respects this and leaves me alone in the break room except for one coworker who, nearly every time without fail, comes in when I am approximately 2-3 minutes into my meal and lingers talking about random things. I immediately lose my ability to eat the moment he walks in and by the time he leaves my break is over and I have to return to work starving. I am starting to get really upset by this but I have no idea how to bring it up or ask for his understanding and cooperation without coming across as a weird mentally fragile idiot. I thought he would eventually notice I stop eating whenever he visits and get the hint but he hasn't. I feel so stupid about this but it's really starting to effect me. I don't want to hurt his feelings but I need to be able to eat to get through the day. What do I say? How do I approach? Should I just start eating lunch in my car?",
