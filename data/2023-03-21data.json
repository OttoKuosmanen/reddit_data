One thing with my boyfriend is that his dick, or specifically the band on the back of the head the \u201cfrenulum\u201d frequently tears. \n\nWhen we first started having sex it would tear in any position. But now he goes extra gentle (which gets annoying) and it\u2019s fine but when I ride him there\u2019s a good chance it tears so I have to feel bad every time I want to go that. \n\nAnd every time it happens we have to wait a week or two for it to heal before he can use it again. I would there\u2019s seriously like a 30% every time I ride him it\u2019ll tear and a 5-10% that if he\u2019s doing it it\u2019ll tear. \n\nI googled and there\u2019s surgery you can get to lengthen the band so it stops tearing. But apparently there\u2019s a slight chance it\u2019ll reduce sensitivity in the dick because the frenulum is pretty sensitive. \n\nHe said he\u2019s not losing feeling in his dick so he won\u2019t get it. I ask what he plans to do then and he said nothing, like literally he plans to do nothing.",

            "Question": "UPDATE: A delusional teenager I work with is telling people we're dating\nFirst of all, thank you for everyone who commented and gave me advice. I wrote a small update in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11tqyw2/a_delusional_teenager_i_work_with_is_telling/) about talking to a lawyer friend. I brought this up to a different manager, mentioning new information that I found out (he was showing people a porn video he found of a girl who looks somewhat like me sucking dick and told people it was me) ANNNND... Nothing. Not. A. Thing. He \"apologized\" saying he didn't want it to go this far and the mangers told us to keep it out of the building. No change of schedule, no consequences, NOTHING. So I'm gonna be going to HR and looking for a new job because this is ABSOLUTE bullshit. I feel disgusted with this place's actions regarding this.\n\nAdditionally, I've contacted his school and requested that they notify his parents because I couldn't find a way to contact them, and at the least if a teacher hears about this there's a paper trail showing I tried to notify them about this little fucker's actions. I'm also lucky enough that he only works weekends and I can see the days he works and try to pick up shifts to avoid him as much as humanly possible. But that's all I have for now. If he comes anywhere near me in the future or if I hear anything else I'm gonna lose my shit, and I'm gonna try and burn this restaurant to the ground. If y'all have any other advice I'm very open to it though! Thanks again guys",

How do I recover from this?\nI (28F) was married with my husband (35M) for 3 years, together for 6 years total. He was the first person I dated. I absolutely adored him. He was the love of my life, my best friend, my life partner. It's sad to say, but I thought he would be the last person on earth to cheat. But here we are.  \n\nI've had so much issues with my mental health since finding out about the affair. I feel so naive. I trusted this man 100 percent. He always portrayed himself as someone with a high moral compass. I remember him expressing how much disdain he has for people who cheat. I did sense something off about him and this girl. I confronted him about it and he managed to look me in the eye and deny everything. He looked me in the fucking eye and told me he loved me and only me. That he would never cheat on me. Only for me to catch him a week after. And then subsequently, leaving me for his affair partner. I just can't imagine trusting anyone again. \n\nFor people who have gone through the same situation, how did you recover?",

            "Question": "my bf's friend sent videos of his gf performing sexual acts on him to my bf and his friends without her consent... help\nMe (f25) and my boyfriend (m29) have been talking for half a year and dating for a month. In conversation, my boyfriend nonchalantly brought up that his friend (m29) had sent him and his other friends videos of his girlfriend performing oral sex on him through snapchat. I asked if this was consensual and he said no, probably not. I flipped out and said this is a crime and so deplorable etc. and my boyfriend was like \"I didn't expect you to react like this.\" I told him that I couldn't date him if he thinks that's okay and he said that he didn't think it was okay but it wasn't his place to say something since it happened 5 years ago. My boyfriend doesn't want to give up his friendship with this person saying that he's been there for him through some tough times and everyone makes mistakes. To me, this is not a mistake, this is a CRIME. Not to mention he did it multiple times. I'm disappointed in my boyfriend for not saying anything and continuing to be this disgusting man's friend. Not to mention, the guy is still dating this girl and she most likely has no idea! I care about my boyfriend so much but I didn't expect something like this from him at all.\n\nAm I overreacting or am I right? I want my boyfriend to stop being friends with him or at least call him out on it, even if it happened years ago. Would this be a justifiable reason to break up with someone even though he wasn't the one who did it?",

            "Question": "Found out my SIL is a possible groomer and my family wants to sweep it under the rug and act like everything is normal\nTLDR: Recently found out my SIL didn\u2019t quit from her school/coaching position for the reason I was told and the real reason is that she was caught messaging a minor that she was coaching and my family wants to pretend it all didn\u2019t happen.\n\nBackstory: months ago my SIL quit her teaching position at a small town school because the stress of it all was destroying her mental health, so she quit but quickly got a new job teaching at another school. SIL was also a coach for a high school team at the first school and is now looking at tying to be a coach again at the new school. \n\nProblem is all of this was a lie.\n\nThe real story is that she \u201cquit\u201d (told to quit or else they would fire her and put it on her record) because she was caught inappropriately messaging a boy on her team. My brother caught her the first time and told her to stop or he\u2019d leave her and tell the school, well she didn\u2019t quit and the school found out on their own.\n\nThing is though that she got another teaching position really soon after losing the first job and even after my brother told her not to, she is pursuing getting another coaching position at the new school. \n\nI\u2019m being kept in the dark as to what was contained in the messages to/from the minor other than being told it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d, but my position is that a coach who is messaging a student at all hours of the night and whose relationship has cause a minor to have to start counseling is a predator, as she either groomed him or was attempting to. And while our family agrees that this behavior is predatory, they are more concerned about whether or not my brother will divorce her and are encouraging marriage counseling.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m going insane here and I\u2019m the only one taking this seriously, like yes it\u2019s sad and unfortunate that my brother may lose his wife, but how are we not addressing that she GROOMED A CHILD and seems to be putting herself in the position to do it again.\n\nI just got off the phone with my mother and asked what the hell I\u2019m supposed to do as Easter where our family will all get together is coming up, am I just supposed to treat her like nothing happened?!\n\nHer answer: yes\n\nAs a survivor of child sexual abuse, I\u2019m not only offended that she\u2019s being invited, but I\u2019m pissed that it\u2019s expected of me to treat her like she didn\u2019t 1) attempt to cheat on my brother 2) attempt to cheat with a MINOR\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019m considering not going to our typical family Easter because I don\u2019t know if I can treat her normally and frankly I don\u2019t want to. She has faced zero consequences for her actions, my brother stayed with her and she got a good job after she \u201cquit\u201d. Do I call the new school and tell them to ask around for what really happened at her old job?\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is all a mess to read, as I\u2019m quite flustered after all this information was dumped on me and I seem to be the only one concerned about her actions and not about the status of their marriage. What do I do?",

She met a girl in a party, they had a making out session and she really enjoyed it. She's gay but that's the first girl she ever hooked up with. Since then they've been sharing some spicy texting and plan to hook up again. The problem is, the girl is 12.\n\nI already told her she should find someone a bit older, maybe 15, and to please stop talking to that girl and not hook up with her. But she's been walking around with some bad influences who told her it's okay, it's not a big deal, that girl hooked up with someone who's 20 before (needless to say they do similar stuff and make out with people much younger and much older). \n\nI don't know what to do.

She\u2019s helped me tremendously over the years through several big life situations. However, several red flags have come up that I just can\u2019t shake and I think I need to part ways: \n\n1) I fall in the middle of the road (but leaning more towards caution) with COVID. I got my shot, I masked when masking was required and followed the guidelines. She is very anti-vax and makes it clear that she doesn\u2019t believe COVID is a big deal. Regardless where anyone falls on the Covid scale, her being so vocal to me about her thoughts somewhat pushed me to alter what I would talk to her about, if it involved something Covid-related. \n\n2) I was taking to her about someone who I have some conflict with. She asked me if they are \u201cre***ded\u201d. Not in a way of thinking they really could have Down syndrome, but in a derogatory way. I am passionate against using that word. \n\n3) Last session, when I showed up, I was outside because a fire alarm went off. Once it was all clear, my therapist and I went inside and she said she was \u201cliterally saved by the bell because she was having to listen to a client who goes on and on - and won\u2019t stop talking.\u201d It put me off that she\u2019s down talking a client of hers. \n\nI\u2019m a bit of a baby when it comes to conflict and would love some advice on how to stop seeing her, in a way that is not massively stressful.",

She essentially worked out in therapy that she's always loved the idea of me, but doesn't know to what extend she actually loves me. \n\nShe has a lot of unresolved youth trauma and never had counseling. She's always \"latched on\" from bf to bf before we got together, which according to her psychiatrist is because of the feeling of not having to go at it alone - something she's had to do all her life as her parents were.. preoccupied. I practically had to force her into therapy.\n\nLast week I've been told she's trying to work out where she stands, because living like this has gotten her numbed off and desperate. She's getting anti-depressants today, and confessed that she just wants to be alone right now. She went as far as preparing me that depending on how the next few months go for her in terms of developing a sense of self, we might not be married anymore by (what would've been) our first anniversary. If she realized she does not love me like that after all, she might decide it's too hard to leave anyway. I just don't see a way where you don't known if you love someone you married 4 months ago, but after a few bouts of therapy you realize you do..\n\nI realize I played a big part in this because she's always had issues expressing herself and I figured it'd get better with time. I guess this is her expressing herself, just not the way I imagined it would go. There are so many questions I can't even begin to ask her, because she doesn't know the answers for herself let alone how to convey them to me. My world's just been shattered, and I'm supposed to keep truckin' on like nothing happened. I can't get any work done, I have a constant feeling of dread pitting in my stomach and I just want to shut down. My boss has been so kind to allow me to WFH for a few days to gather myself, but as I can't focus I'm afraid they'll think I'm just loafing around.\n\nWhat hurts me the most is thinking about our weddingday, when I was bawling my eyes out on for the love of my life and she just went through the motions because that was what was expected of her..\n\nI'm expected to give her space, but all I want to do is crawl in bed next to her and cuddle all day.

My parents are divorced and my father has primary custody and we are with my mother every other weekend. My twin sister Mia and I are extremely close and always have been. \n\nMia is gay and that\u2019s the main reason my stepfather has been mean to her ever since he met her but Saturday he crossed a line. I\u2019ve talked to my father about how my stepfather behaves towards my sister and he\u2019s had multiple conversations with my stepfather telling him to quit some of which have gotten very heated. Most of what he\u2019s been doing is calling her names and being very rude and disrespectful towards her. \n\nSaturday my sister had just gotten out of the shower she had gotten dressed walking out of the upstairs bathroom which is a few steps away from the top of the stairs. My mom and stepfather\u2019s bedroom right beside it. As my sister was walking out of the bathroom she had turned to walk down the stairs when my stepfather came out of the bedroom. He called her a homophobic slur then pushed her from behind and sent her falling down the stairs. \n\nI ran to check on my sister and aside from a broken arm and busted lip she was ok. I then called 911 and asked for the police and an ambulance. The police arrived first and I told them what had happened and they arrested my stepfather for aggravated battery. The ambulance arrived not long after to take my sister to the hospital. I rode in the ambulance with my sister and called our father who met us at the hospital. \n\nMy sister is ok they took X-rays and checked her for other injuries then put a cast on her arm that she\u2019ll get off in about two months. They kept her overnight for observation then sent her home the following morning. So she\u2019s going to be just fine. \n\nSince then my mother has been calling me nonstop and sending me text messages telling me that I ruined her life and should be ashamed for calling 911 and not giving her time to make up a story before taking my sister to the hospital. My father has called my mother and told her to knock it off and that she\u2019s lucky the police handled my stepfather and not him. It\u2019s safe to say that we won\u2019t be having to stay with my mother for awhile if ever and my sister and I both are happy about that. I have my mothers number blocked and so does my sister. \n\nI just don\u2019t understand how someone can be so hateful. I don\u2019t feel like I did anything wrong but I could use some advice.",

I\u2019ve been so happy with her and I genuinely find a future with her. \n\nI was out on a work trip for a week and met this wonderful lady at the event. We spent some time together between our crew and theirs and had a couple nights out of drinking. Some sexual innuendos came from her to me, such as \u201cI\u2019d love to cuddle with you\u201d and \u201cif you roofied me I wouldn\u2019t mind\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t know why but for some reason this turned me onto her but I was feeling uneasy about the situation too. On the last night her, my coworker, and I were in her hotel room talking for hours. After we left, she texted me and was asking if I was single. (Obviously hinting to hooking up). Never have I felt more tempted to get up, knock on her door, and spend the night. But I didn\u2019t, I told her about my relationship and she was very happy for me and understood my position.\n\nIt is now the next morning and I feel like I am regretting not getting up and going to her room. I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019ve never been in this situation before, no other woman has came onto me like that. I don\u2019t know how to feel now.\n\nDo I tell my girlfriend about my experience? Should I just keep it to myself? What should I do if I see her again?",

            "Question": "Boyfriend constantly not sure if he wants me\nLong story short:\n\nMe (26F) and my boyfriends (26M) were together for 2 years. Everything was ok the first 6 months. I fell into a horrible depression, that kind that makes not to be able to eat, sleep, stay alone. He was not supportive and cricitized me for taking medication and not doing things to get better. That was just a month or two. He also confessed that has thought about separation and couldnt stand the situation with me being depressed, because he was feeling ok and wanted someone that motivates him to be productive and do things. Also he left me alone after a panick attack at a doctor's appointment (I also had health issues, this being the main reason for my depression), because it was his lunch break and wanted to get back home to eat.\n\nFast forward I recovered quickly and forgave him. After 3 months he wanted again to separate because we had a routine and he didnt feel challanged by the relationship. We stayed together.\n\nFast forward again after 6 months he wanted again to separate and start telling that he doesnt know what he wants. He also said he wanted separation and after 5 min said he didnt. We stayed together.\n\nAgain fast forward 2 months I felt he  has changed behaviour and asked him if moving together was still on the table as we decided a month ago. He said no, I am not the girl he sees his future with and also he has seen his high school love with whom he had been in a \"relationship\" for 3 weeks and compared feelings and the ones for her were stronger. I broke up with him.\n\nHe begged me to stay, promised he will change, came to see me in the hospital, was extremely nice to me, said to move together. I forgave him.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks later(he was very nice and caring)  I made a joke that I want to eat meat again (we both dont eat meet). He said he wanted to break up, that he had these thoughts about not knowing what we wants again. After 5 min he regreted and wanted to stay together. I left.\n\nNow he tells me to forgive him that he loves me and doesnt know why he behaves like this and he is depressed.\n\n\nOpinions are welcomed:)",

Recently, my sister started dating this new guy who seemed nice at first, but he ended up disrespecting me in a way that I just can't let go.\n\nIt happened at a get-together my sister hosted at our parents' house. We were playing a game when he made a comment about how I was taking too long to make a move, and then he smirked and said, \"I guess that's what happens when you're not very smart.\" To be fair, my sister is way smarter than me and she's really great at these games too. But it was clear to me that he was trying to insult me, and I was taken aback.\n\nI didn't want to make a scene in front of everyone, so I tried to brush it off and continued with the game. But then he made another comment about how I must be bad at strategy games because I didn't go to college. That is not fair, I went to college but just not as good as my sister's. I was shocked and hurt. I couldn't believe he was being so blatantly insulting.\n\nAs the night went on, he made a few more snide remarks that were meant to put me down. It became clear to me that he was deliberately trying to provoke me. I tried my best to ignore him, but it was difficult to enjoy the evening after that.\n\nNow my sister wants to bring him to our family dinner next week, and I'm hesitant to let him come. I don't want to be around someone who doesn't respect me, and I feel like inviting him would just be condoning his behavior.\n\nMy sister thinks I'm being unreasonable and being too sensitive, and that I should give him a chance to make things right. But I just can't shake the feeling that I would be betraying myself if I let him come.\n\nMy parents want him to come too. It feels like I'm the only person who doesn't want him there. \n\nShould I be firm and ask her not to bring him, let her bring him and pretend nothing happened or not attend the dinner at all?\n\nEdit:\nTo clear up some confusion, I'm a female. My sister is 9 years older than me. I live with my parents. This is my sister's first serious boyfriend so she's acting a bit out of character. She's not usually like this. My sister took care of me growing up because both parents were busy working. I don't want to disrespect her because I see her as a mother and a role model.\nI just wanted you all to look at it from every perspective. Thank you for your kind comments so far as well.",

            "Question": "i created a fake account and found out my ex dumped me because i'm black\nI was having one of those nights where i was thinking of him again. I never understood why our relationship didn't work out, I felt there was a real reason that only he knew but didn't want to admit. My looks maybe? My personality, how clingy i got? However i am a terrible overthinker so i dismissed those type of thoughts, the silly thoughts that we have like \"it's because you're black\". Despite feeling left in the dark, i tried my best to make the relationship work, every effort made.\n\nBecause why would he date me in the first place if it was that? Why would we go out, why would he pay for our meals, we'd spend hours talking, have all these intimate moments, just for him to not actually want to pursue anything with me... due to my race?\n\nWell, girls, it is the exact reason. I created a fake account last night and started chatting him up. He confessed everything , to a stranger ! (Me using a fake account meant i was a stranger to him). In his words \"I would've kept dating her if she was white.\" My heart dropped when i read the message. He went on to say \" it's the fact that I'd never want a half black child\" ... I could only marry a white woman\". He's allowed his preferences i believe, but why string me along the whole time..?\n\nAnd so after moments of hurt, i tried healing myself, a little self reflection, trying to keep away flashbacks and tears. A little motivational reading, some looking at myself in the mirror and telling myself \"i am worth it!!\" However i'm starting to think, this is something i should get used to?\n\nI am feeling upset more than angry, i feel like a waste if that makes any sense, i feel stupid. I will never talk to him ever again, for sure. But part of me wants to hire a hitman. \n\nWas i ignorant to think that i could be successful in the dating realm, being the colour that i am? This is the reality for us girls ,right? Or could it be a geographical thing, maybe i'm not looking in the right places. Whatever the conclusion i don't know, i'm wondering if any other girls have been in this situation? Or if you have any advice, support to give? I'd appreciate it. Thanks, have a nice day all!",
