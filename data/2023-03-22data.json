I really would like some advice because I feel bad but I also have my own children to think of and can't afford to lose 8hrs of pay.\nThankyou!",

So I\u2019m guy in my 20s who grew up REALLY religious. As a kid we had a close family friend who I\u2019d spend many nights at his house and he at mine. On a few occasions his older cousin in her teens baby sat us when our parents went out or did events with our church. His cousin was also a member of our church and his family had a lot of prestige within our parish. \n\nWith that as the backdrop, when she would baby sit us she\u2019d let us play and do whatever. But after a while she would call us down to the family computer and porn would be one. She\u2019d have her hand in her pants and call us over. She\u2019d then have me and my friend do things to each other, to her, and she\u2019d do it back to us. It felt good to me but I knew it was wrong, even at 9 years old. She told us not to tell anyone or else our parents would get kicked out of the church. \n\nThis same pattern went on when I was well into my teens until we no longer needed a baby sitter. During puberty this was especially confusing because I didn\u2019t like men but was forced to do sex acts on my friend. Adding to that, i also lost my virginity to her and felt so impure. I didn\u2019t date anyone in HS because of this. I felt undeserving of love and confused about my sexuality. \n\nI experimented plenty when I went off to college and don\u2019t really have ties to the faith anymore. There is still a level of catholic guilt that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever escape but that\u2019s not all that present in my thoughts these days. The first girl I opened up to about my past left me because I was \u201cwith a man\u201d and I just don\u2019t know that I ever will be willing to be vulnerable like that again. \n\nI guess the reason for this post is to ask if anyone out there has had a similar experience and how you manage? I\u2019ve done therapy in the past but can\u2019t afford it at the moment. \n\nI also want to explore my sexuality further but have a lot of trust issues. Is there a place on Reddit to do so?

            "Question": "Found out my SIL is a possible groomer and my family wants to sweep it under the rug and act like everything is normal\nTLDR: Recently found out my SIL didn\u2019t quit from her school/coaching position for the reason I was told and the real reason is that she was caught messaging a minor that she was coaching and my family wants to pretend it all didn\u2019t happen.\n\nBackstory: months ago my SIL quit her teaching position at a small town school because the stress of it all was destroying her mental health, so she quit but quickly got a new job teaching at another school. SIL was also a coach for a high school team at the first school and is now looking at tying to be a coach again at the new school. \n\nProblem is all of this was a lie.\n\nThe real story is that she \u201cquit\u201d (told to quit or else they would fire her and put it on her record) because she was caught inappropriately messaging a boy on her team. My brother caught her the first time and told her to stop or he\u2019d leave her and tell the school, well she didn\u2019t quit and the school found out on their own.\n\nThing is though that she got another teaching position really soon after losing the first job and even after my brother told her not to, she is pursuing getting another coaching position at the new school. \n\nI\u2019m being kept in the dark as to what was contained in the messages to/from the minor other than being told it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d, but my position is that a coach who is messaging a student at all hours of the night and whose relationship has cause a minor to have to start counseling is a predator, as she either groomed him or was attempting to. And while our family agrees that this behavior is predatory, they are more concerned about whether or not my brother will divorce her and are encouraging marriage counseling.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m going insane here and I\u2019m the only one taking this seriously, like yes it\u2019s sad and unfortunate that my brother may lose his wife, but how are we not addressing that she GROOMED A CHILD and seems to be putting herself in the position to do it again.\n\nI just got off the phone with my mother and asked what the hell I\u2019m supposed to do as Easter where our family will all get together is coming up, am I just supposed to treat her like nothing happened?!\n\nHer answer: yes\n\nAs a survivor of child sexual abuse, I\u2019m not only offended that she\u2019s being invited, but I\u2019m pissed that it\u2019s expected of me to treat her like she didn\u2019t 1) attempt to cheat on my brother 2) attempt to cheat with a MINOR\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019m considering not going to our typical family Easter because I don\u2019t know if I can treat her normally and frankly I don\u2019t want to. She has faced zero consequences for her actions, my brother stayed with her and she got a good job after she \u201cquit\u201d. Do I call the new school and tell them to ask around for what really happened at her old job?\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is all a mess to read, as I\u2019m quite flustered after all this information was dumped on me and I seem to be the only one concerned about her actions and not about the status of their marriage. What do I do?",

She met a girl in a party, they had a making out session and she really enjoyed it. She's gay but that's the first girl she ever hooked up with. Since then they've been sharing some spicy texting and plan to hook up again. The problem is, the girl is 12.\n\nI already told her she should find someone a bit older, maybe 15, and to please stop talking to that girl and not hook up with her. But she's been walking around with some bad influences who told her it's okay, it's not a big deal, that girl hooked up with someone who's 20 before (needless to say they do similar stuff and make out with people much younger and much older). \n\nI don't know what to do. She's a very sweet and almost naive girl, but this is just wrong. A 12yo shouldn't be hooking up with randoms at parties much less a goddamn 18yo, no matter their character.\n\nedit: I can't call the cops on her, first because I DON'T want her to get in trouble, I'm trying to keep her out of it. Besides, age of consent is a thing people overlook around here specially since they haven't even had sex. Adult men impregnate tweens and no one bats an eye.\n\nI can't talk to parents either, specially her parents. Her mom is super strict, super homophobic and quite literally insane. If she finds out about her sexuality she will probably kick her out or spank her and forbid her from having any contact from the outside world for life. That's not what I want. I don't want to punish her, she doesn't even realize what she's doing, I want her to stop from doing something that'll fuck her up or this girl.",

She\u2019s helped me tremendously over the years through several big life situations. However, several red flags have come up that I just can\u2019t shake and I think I need to part ways: \n\n1) I fall in the middle of the road (but leaning more towards caution) with COVID. I got my shot, I masked when masking was required and followed the guidelines. She is very anti-vax and makes it clear that she doesn\u2019t believe COVID is a big deal. Regardless where anyone falls on the Covid scale, her being so vocal to me about her thoughts somewhat pushed me to alter what I would talk to her about, if it involved something Covid-related. \n\n2) I was taking to her about someone who I have some conflict with. She asked me if they are \u201cre***ded\u201d. Not in a way of thinking they really could have Down syndrome, but in a derogatory way. I am passionate against using that word. \n\n3) Last session, when I showed up, I was outside because a fire alarm went off. Once it was all clear, my therapist and I went inside and she said she was \u201cliterally saved by the bell because she was having to listen to a client who goes on and on - and won\u2019t stop talking.\u201d It put me off that she\u2019s down talking a client of hers. \n\nI\u2019m a bit of a baby when it comes to conflict and would love some advice on how to stop seeing her, in a way that is not massively stressful.",

She essentially worked out in therapy that she's always loved the idea of me, but doesn't know to what extend she actually loves me. \n\nShe has a lot of unresolved youth trauma and never had counseling. She's always \"latched on\" from bf to bf before we got together, which according to her psychiatrist is because of the feeling of not having to go at it alone - something she's had to do all her life as her parents were.. preoccupied. I practically had to force her into therapy.\n\nLast week I've been told she's trying to work out where she stands, because living like this has gotten her numbed off and desperate. She's getting anti-depressants today, and confessed that she just wants to be alone right now. She went as far as preparing me that depending on how the next few months go for her in terms of developing a sense of self, we might not be married anymore by (what would've been) our first anniversary. If she realized she does not love me like that after all, she might decide it's too hard to leave anyway. I just don't see a way where you don't known if you love someone you married 4 months ago, but after a few bouts of therapy you realize you do..\n\nI realize I played a big part in this because she's always had issues expressing herself and I figured it'd get better with time. I guess this is her expressing herself, just not the way I imagined it would go. There are so many questions I can't even begin to ask her, because she doesn't know the answers for herself let alone how to convey them to me. My world's just been shattered, and I'm supposed to keep truckin' on like nothing happened. I can't get any work done, I have a constant feeling of dread pitting in my stomach and I just want to shut down. My boss has been so kind to allow me to WFH for a few days to gather myself, but as I can't focus I'm afraid they'll think I'm just loafing around.\n\nWhat hurts me the most is thinking about our weddingday, when I was bawling my eyes out on for the love of my life and she just went through the motions because that was what was expected of her..\n\nI'm expected to give her space, but all I want to do is crawl in bed next to her and cuddle all day.

My parents are divorced and my father has primary custody and we are with my mother every other weekend. My twin sister Mia and I are extremely close and always have been. \n\nMia is gay and that\u2019s the main reason my stepfather has been mean to her ever since he met her but Saturday he crossed a line. I\u2019ve talked to my father about how my stepfather behaves towards my sister and he\u2019s had multiple conversations with my stepfather telling him to quit some of which have gotten very heated. Most of what he\u2019s been doing is calling her names and being very rude and disrespectful towards her. \n\nSaturday my sister had just gotten out of the shower she had gotten dressed walking out of the upstairs bathroom which is a few steps away from the top of the stairs. My mom and stepfather\u2019s bedroom right beside it. As my sister was walking out of the bathroom she had turned to walk down the stairs when my stepfather came out of the bedroom. He called her a homophobic slur then pushed her from behind and sent her falling down the stairs. \n\nI ran to check on my sister and aside from a broken arm and busted lip she was ok. I then called 911 and asked for the police and an ambulance. The police arrived first and I told them what had happened and they arrested my stepfather for aggravated battery. The ambulance arrived not long after to take my sister to the hospital. I rode in the ambulance with my sister and called our father who met us at the hospital. \n\nMy sister is ok they took X-rays and checked her for other injuries then put a cast on her arm that she\u2019ll get off in about two months. They kept her overnight for observation then sent her home the following morning. So she\u2019s going to be just fine. \n\nSince then my mother has been calling me nonstop and sending me text messages telling me that I ruined her life and should be ashamed for calling 911 and not giving her time to make up a story before taking my sister to the hospital. My father has called my mother and told her to knock it off and that she\u2019s lucky the police handled my stepfather and not him. It\u2019s safe to say that we won\u2019t be having to stay with my mother for awhile if ever and my sister and I both are happy about that.
