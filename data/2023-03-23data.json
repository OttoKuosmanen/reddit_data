I was like \"Umm...wtf? Why?\"\n\nHe told me that from the pic, it's clear that I don't have big boobs. Apparently he had been bragging (and lying) to his friends that I have really big boobs. I was really angry when he told me this and he was just like \"It's okay that you don't have big boobs....I love your boobs, I just wanted to seem cooler and tell my friends that my gf has huge boobs\".\n\nUm.... obviously YOU DO wish I had bigger boobs or you wouldn't lie to your friends and say that I have big ones when I don't. I'm honestly considering breaking up but I'm not sure....he has always been so amazing to me for the 6 months that we have been together. But this really made me angry.\n\nThis is the pic I posted that he asked me to delete....now I feel a bit insecure about myself and I'm wondering if that's really the reason? Like is there just something wrong with this pic or do you think the \"your boobs don't look big enough\" excuse is the real reason he said it? https://i.imgur.com/KY5F1rX.jpg\n\ntl;dr My bf told me to delete a pic because my boobs don't look big enough and now I don't know if I should continue dating him or if I should trust him\n\nEdit: OMG IT GETS WORSE! I have an older sister and she actually does have very big boobs, and apparently he showed her pics to his friends and pretended that was me!!! WHAT THE FUCK!",

Just for context, She says weird stuff sometimes, and she seems to try to get my attention a lot more than she does with others. Might just be because I tend to be pretty approachable ig, don\u2019t really know why tho. So basically, a few days ago, she said something really weird. Idk if this is normal behavior, or it might be some internet trend thing I haven\u2019t noticed. She said quote \u201ccan you bark for me\u201d in the middle of class in a rather demanding way. I normally don\u2019t have a problem with weird humor. But holy shit that was weird. I kinda just froze and smiled awkwardly at her. Cuz like wtf was I supposed to say? The girl sitting next to me gave me a weird look and we went back to studying. My question is, what should I do with this? Should I just forget it happend or bring it up?\n\nOh and we are high schoolers, and I apologize for any grammar mistakes. English is not my native language, and my understanding of it is rather limited\n\nTLDR: girl asked me to bark in I\u2019m still in shock form how odd it was",

I met my bf in university and he kept telling me that his birthday was to where we were only 2 years apart (1998). For several months, I was rather suspicious of this because there were photos of him on Instagram tagged in frat formals from dates to where if that was his birth year, it wouldn\u2019t have made sense because it would mean that he would be in high school. During Xmas, I finally went through his license and saw that his birthday was in 1990 instead of 1998, making him actually 10 years older than me. I felt betrayed seeing this and tried to forgive him. Despite this, I cannot help continue to be reminded of this from time to time and how he basically lied to me for almost a year of our relationship. I love him a whole lot, and believe that he\u2019s the best for me but I cannot get over this big lie he kept from me. What should I do?",

So I\u2019m guy in my 20s who grew up REALLY religious. As a kid we had a close family friend who I\u2019d spend many nights at his house and he at mine. On a few occasions his older cousin in her teens baby sat us when our parents went out or did events with our church. His cousin was also a member of our church and his family had a lot of prestige within our parish. \n\nWith that as the backdrop, when she would baby sit us she\u2019d let us play and do whatever. But after a while she would call us down to the family computer and porn would be one. She\u2019d have her hand in her pants and call us over. She\u2019d then have me and my friend do things to each other, to her, and she\u2019d do it back to us. It felt good to me but I knew it was wrong, even at 9 years old. She told us not to tell anyone or else our parents would get kicked out of the church. \n\nThis same pattern went on when I was well into my teens until we no longer needed a baby sitter. During puberty this was especially confusing because I didn\u2019t like men but was forced to do sex acts on my friend. Adding to that, i also lost my virginity to her and felt so impure. I didn\u2019t date anyone in HS because of this. I felt undeserving of love and confused about my sexuality. \n\nI experimented plenty when I went off to college and don\u2019t really have ties to the faith anymore. There is still a level of catholic guilt that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever escape but that\u2019s not all that present in my thoughts these days. The first girl I opened up to about my past left me because I was \u201cwith a man\u201d and I just don\u2019t know that I ever will be willing to be vulnerable like that again. \n\nI guess the reason for this post is to ask if anyone out there has had a similar experience and how you manage? I\u2019ve done therapy in the past but can\u2019t afford it at the moment. \n\nI also want to explore my sexuality further but have a lot of trust issues. Is there a place on Reddit to do so?

Because again, I'm not interested in anything so what else was I supposed to do?\n\nI just have no career ambitions at all and people are treating me like I can't do anything until I have them. But I can't just sit around waiting to suddenly be interested in something. I don't know what I'm supposed to do.",

            "Question": "[18f] [18m] my boyfriend won\u2019t get the surgery he needs for his dick\n\nWe\u2019ve been going out a year and a half now. One thing with my boyfriend is that his dick, or specifically the band on the back of the head the \u201cfrenulum\u201d frequently tears. \n\nWhen we first started having sex it would tear in any position. But now he goes extra gentle (which gets annoying) and it\u2019s fine but when I ride him there\u2019s a good chance it tears so I have to feel bad every time I want to go that. \n\nAnd every time it happens we have to wait a week or two for it to heal before he can use it again. I would there\u2019s seriously like a 30% every time I ride him it\u2019ll tear and a 5-10% that if he\u2019s doing it it\u2019ll tear. \n\nI googled and there\u2019s surgery you can get to lengthen the band so it stops tearing. But apparently there\u2019s a slight chance it\u2019ll reduce sensitivity in the dick because the frenulum is pretty sensitive. \n\nHe said he\u2019s not losing feeling in his dick so he won\u2019t get it. I ask what he plans to do then and he said nothing, like literally he plans to do nothing.",

            "Question": "What should I do with people that wouldn't leave me alone in the gym at night?\n\n\nI [M27] am a, although thankfully functional, neurodivergent person.\n\nI am not comfortable around people and I relax and calm myself through repetitive behaviour.\n\nFor this reason I love going to a nearby 24/7 gym and at night. I can use the same machine for one or two hours (I usually take three hour sessions in total) without anybody else waiting for me to finish and often there isn't anybody else in the first place. (Mostly running or other repetitive things).\n\nRecently I have been approached by people that are making me very uncomfortable. They insist on asking questions about me, my work, my salary and don't seem to take kindly me not willing to answer al talk at all. They grab stuff from my bag (like my brush when I am done with it, they then use it on their own hair and give it back to me but it still grosses me out and it's unnerving).\n\nI just want to be left alone, but I don't want to lose the place that has been my coping mechanism for so long.\n\nWhat should I do?",

            "Question": "Is it irresponsible to hit a dab pen if you\u2019re the only one watching your kid but they\u2019re asleep?\nI thought it might help me relax, so I hit a dab pen that I keep safely put away in a box at the top of my closet where you\u2019re supposed to put hats. I rarely ever use it and it\u2019s been about 6 months since I hit it. Anyway, I wasn\u2019t expecting to get as high as I just got from one hit. Now I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s a small chance my daughter might wake up, and I don\u2019t know if this was an irresponsible move. I have everything around here taken care of, and I\u2019m not struggling to get by or provide, but yet getting high just now has made me question all of that and wonder if I\u2019m even fit to be a parent. \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m just high and it\u2019s actually not that irresponsible, because I\u2019m not impaired or unable to look after her if she wakes up, but I need a little bit of reassurance. My mom called a few minutes after I got high. Everyone always acts so concerned about me, and they always give me advice on what to do and check in on me, because they all think I\u2019m not cut out to be a single parent. None of my family or former in laws trust me at all. That\u2019s the only reason my mom called, and that made me start to wonder if maybe they\u2019re all right about me. I think this was a minor mistake, I didn\u2019t know I was going to get as high as I did, but I don\u2019t think this was irresponsible. Was this pretty bad and a sign that they\u2019re right, or not that big of a deal? If I wasn\u2019t high I would probably be able to know, but I can\u2019t work it out at the moment",

            "Question": "My husband cheated on me and then left me for his affair partner. How do I recover from this?\nI (28F) was married with my husband (35M) for 3 years, together for 6 years total. He was the first person I dated. I absolutely adored him. He was the love of my life, my best friend, my life partner. It's sad to say, but I thought he would be the last person on earth to cheat. But here we are.  \n\nI've had so much issues with my mental health since finding out about the affair. I feel so naive. I trusted this man 100 percent. He always portrayed himself as someone with a high moral compass. I remember him expressing how much disdain he has for people who cheat. I did sense something off about him and this girl. I confronted him about it and he managed to look me in the eye and deny everything. He looked me in the fucking eye and told me he loved me and only me. That he would never cheat on me. Only for me to catch him a week after. And then subsequently, leaving me for his affair partner. I just can't imagine trusting anyone again. \n\nFor people who have gone through the same situation, how did you recover?  \n\nEdit: I feel so moved by everyone's responses. Thank you so much for the kind words, advices, perspectives, and stories. I hope to be at a better place in the near future. I'll do my best.",
