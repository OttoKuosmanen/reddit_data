What should i do?\nIt's literally my birthday and 12:15 and she screams (wakes up both kids) I WILL DIVORCE YOU IF YOU KEEP PLAYING GAMES LIKE THIS! I'm a night owl. I'm not goin to lay in bed and stare at the ceiling. I enjoy competive gaming (i dont scream lets go and wake  everyone up). It's something I'm good at and she is belittling it saying it's for kids. I was # 2 in the world with a character and she calls me a fa***t for my efforts. I support her and our 2 kids 100% they have everything they could ever want. Even bought her a new bronco that she has given to her parents to drive after she put all of 3000 miles on it. . I just don't understand how it effects her or anyone if i stay up late if it doesn't effect what I get up and do everyday. Day by day by day.",

            "Question": "My girlfriend (22F) won\u2019t change her shampoo even though I\u2019m (25M) allergic to it?\nWe\u2019ve been dating for about 6 months now. When we first started dating things were okay, but a couple months in, every time we would sleep over at eachothers place my face would break out in a crazy rash, my eyes would get super swollen and gunky, and I just looked and felt terrible. \n\nShe seemed slightly concerned at first. I told her that the only thing that has made this happen to me before is an ingredient in a lot of soaps and shampoos that I\u2019m allergic to. We looked through everything we own and use together and didn\u2019t find it in anything, except her shampoo. I told her that\u2019s probably what was causing it, since her hair would be near/on my face when we slept together. I asked her if she could possibly get new shampoo, and she said no.\n\nI asked her why not; she said that she really likes the way that shampoo feels and that she spent $100 on it (they\u2019re pretty big bottles). I told her I could give her some money to get new shampoo and she said no, she\u2019s not changing it. This conversation was 2 months ago. I try to bring it up every couple weeks, because my eyes and face have been red and swollen for months, but she kind of just laughs it off or changes the subject. It bugs me too because she always mentions \u201coh my god your eyes look so bad babe\u201d and I\u2019m just like\u2026 yeah, and we both know why? It\u2019s literally your soap.\n\nI\u2019m kind of at a loss, I understand that she likes the shampoo but it\u2019s physically affecting me negatively and I\u2019m getting kind of sick of people at work asking if I got beat up in a fight lol. Is there something I could do or say to her to make her change her mind? Am I asking too much of her? I kind of feel like I\u2019m going crazy.",

            "Question": "How do i handle this feeling of guilt as an (ex?) gay muslim?\nIt is the first day of Ramadan, what used to be one of my favourite \u201cholidays\u201d in the muslim agenda. However, as a college student living away from family it is so difficult for multiple reasons. \n\nI am a gay male, with that comes completely being considered a sin in the muslim community or even within the religion, apparently. So, why would i be apart of a religion that doesn\u2019t accept me? I began to push myself away from the religion and now it\u2019s Ramadan. I cannot even explain that feeling of guilt thats just rooted within me because I don\u2019t want to partake in it. I have to lie to my parents and family in saying i am doing it, but im not. \n\nI was never given a choice in whether I wanna be religious or not anyways, I was simply just born into it. And that is so unfair and no one should EVER be born into a religion, it should be a choice. Anyways, after realizing and accepting myself in that I am not a straight male (and  because of that, my literal existence is a sin), and that i don\u2019t agree with most of the views in that religion, I dont wanna be apart of it. But, that feeling of guilt will always be with me, forever. Being told growing up that your parents will have to suffer if their kids are not religious, or following the religion is traumatizing. It sucks and it is so mentally draining.\n\nHow can i ease this feeling of guilt?",

Regret, loneliness, longing; holidays are strong, cultural times. Maybe you miss the cultural side of it. You may not be able to celebrate Rahmadan with your family, but your college community may have you. Do it for you, not God or Muhammad or anyone else.\n\nPlenty of former Christians Celebrate \"Christian\" holidays because its often not about Christ. It's about community.",

I met my bf in university and he kept telling me that his birthday was to where we were only 2 years apart (1998).
