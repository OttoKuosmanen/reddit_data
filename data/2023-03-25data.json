            "Question": "I left a family reunion early after my uncle slapped my daughter in the face. Now everyone including my parents is saying I overreacted.\nHello everyone my name is Alena I\u2019m 33 years old and my daughter Quinn is 11. Last Saturday was my family\u2019s annual reunion and I went and took my daughter with me. Everything was going good for about the first two hours before my daughter came running to me crying. She said that my uncle who\u2019s known to be a grouchy person slapped her in the face after she bumped into him while playing with one of the other kids. She looked up at me and she had a big red handprint on the right side of her face. I confronted my uncle and he said that my daughter needed to watch where she was going and I told him that I didn\u2019t care and he was never to raise a hand towards my child then I took my daughter and we left. Since then my parents and some other family members have been calling and texting me saying I overreacted and that I know how my uncle is to which I have said I don\u2019t care he is not to ever hurt my child. I don\u2019t think I overreacted at all what do you guys think.",

I live in an apartment and the neighbor\u2019s upstairs bathroom is right on top of mine so I can always hear when they run their shower/bath. Their water has been running for like legit 5 hours. No sign of flooding though (it would\u2019ve spilled down to my bathroom). Should I like call maintenance or somebody or something? Thanks!\n\nUPDATE: Sorry for the delay, after contacting police I fell asleep and it took them like a few hours to even come out and check. Neighbor is fine, they (for whatever unknown reason) left the shower on and left the house. They\u2019re not elderly, but may be mentally unwell. \n\nAnyways, shower is off now and it ran for a total of like 10 hours. Weird shit and complete waste of tons of water I\u2019m water.

He always tells me how important sex is for men and how they can\u2019t function without it. I can\u2019t see him as much because I\u2019ve been working a lot and I also go to school part time. He barely works and always have time on his hands. Just laying in his house. \n\nAs soon as he gets sexually frustrated he starts with his nonsense.

Buying him food, giving him money, being a shoulder for him to cry on. \n\nIs this sexual manipulation? What should I do?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that our most recent argument was because I\u2019ve recently got over a really bad illness that left me sick for two weeks and bedridden. And he immediately started threatening me with the cheating. He told me that a women would never let her man leave the house sexually frustrated.\n\n\nUpdate: I\u2019ve broken up with him! I sent him a text telling him how I felt about everything and I used some of the stuff you guys said. I blocked him on every single social media site including regular phone. I want thank you guys for all your support and patience. You guys really helped me a lot today. I\u2019m  going to take time to just heal and worry about myself. \u2764\ufe0f",

I see her almost weekly and she does so much for me and my family. She\u2019s currently watching me and my siblings for a month while my parents are on vacation. On to the problem. \nWhen I was 16 I got my first tattoo with parent permission. It\u2019s about the size of my fist and is a gorgeous floral design that I\u2019m absolutely in love with. My nan is very religious (Jehovahs witness) and very much against tattoos. I hadn\u2019t told my nan but she saw it yesterday while I was eating dinner. She called me out telling me how disappointed in me she was, how Im too young, how I am just \u201cfollowing the crowd\u201d, She called my heavily tattooed mother revolting and is now not speaking to me. I understand her point but I had been planning on getting a tattoo since I was like 10 and was set on my design for more then a year before I got it. I don\u2019t really know what to do and I\u2019m worried that things will never go back to normal.

I\u2019ll update later on how it goes <3\n\n\nEdit 2.0: hi guys this is for anyone in case they were curious. I talked to my nan and told her that she doesn\u2019t have to respect my choices but she needs to respect me enough to not bring them up and some more. She\u2019s still upset that I got it but she knows that won\u2019t change anything. We are on proper speaking terms but now just to keep the piece I\u2019m making sure to keep the tat out of sight.

I told her that\u2019s probably what was causing it, since her hair would be near/on my face when we slept together.

I told her I could give her some money to get new shampoo and she said no, she\u2019s not changing it. This conversation was 2 months ago.

            "Question": "How do i handle this feeling of guilt as an (ex?) gay muslim?\nIt is the first day of Ramadan, what used to be one of my favourite \u201cholidays\u201d in the muslim agenda. However, as a college student living away from family it is so difficult for multiple reasons. \n\nI am a gay male, with that comes completely being considered a sin in the muslim community or even within the religion, apparently. So, why would i be apart of a religion that doesn\u2019t accept me? I began to push myself away from the religion and now it\u2019s Ramadan. I cannot even explain that feeling of guilt thats just rooted within me because I don\u2019t want to partake in it. I have to lie to my parents and family in saying i am doing it, but im not. \n\nI was never given a choice in whether I wanna be religious or not anyways, I was simply just born into it. And that is so unfair and no one should EVER be born into a religion, it should be a choice. Anyways, after realizing and accepting myself in that I am not a straight male (and  because of that, my literal existence is a sin), and that i don\u2019t agree with most of the views in that religion, I dont wanna be apart of it. But, that feeling of guilt will always be with me, forever. Being told growing up that your parents will have to suffer if their kids are not religious, or following the religion is traumatizing. It sucks and it is so mentally draining.\n\nHow can i ease this feeling of guilt?",

Others around you decided to kick you out and banish you for how God made you. You don't kick a ball then be mad it rolled away.\n\nOn another note, its easy confuse guilt with other emotions. Regret, loneliness, longing; holidays are strong, cultural times. Maybe you miss the cultural side of it. You may not be able to celebrate Rahmadan with your family, but your college community may have you. Do it for you, not God or Muhammad or anyone else.\n\nPlenty of former Christians Celebrate \"Christian\" holidays because its often not about Christ. It's about community.",

            "Question": "Should I take a loan out for my friend?\nA friend hit me up saying they\u2019ve fallen on financial hardships and needs 2,500$ or for me to co-sign a loan for them. Obviously I want to help them, however I\u2019ve lent a close friend of mine money in the past and they never paid me back which in turn ruined our friendship. \n\nI don\u2019t want this to happen again but my friend will end up homeless other wise. She works under the table jobs and since I have a stable job I could help her out. I don\u2019t know much about loans but I heard they help credit.Could it benefit me in the long run? What should I be cautious about? Any advice?",

You should assume you will be fully responsible and it will wreck your credit when they miss payments. \n\nThey can get a prepaid debit/credit card to help their credit and won't need a cosigner.\n\nDo not do this.",

            "Question": "How to amicably break up with a friend without ghosting them or causing a scene?\nSort of in an awkward situation. I have this friend who I used to enjoy or at least not mind hanging out with. We\u2019ve had two falling outs and the last one was kind of their fault. I don\u2019t want to make a big scene but I also don\u2019t want to continue our friendship. They actually have a lot of friends, and I\u2019m the more introverted one. I honestly don\u2019t know how we even became friends in the first place; I feel like we don\u2019t have much in common and I honestly don\u2019t love spending time with them (sometimes they say things that aren't the kindest - e.g. made a comment about someone being introverted and sitting alone, even though I'm introverted and often do that). They think we\u2019ve \u201cmade up\u201d and want to even work on this group project with me. I was prepared to just say, hey, I think I need some time away, but when they came to apologize, I just chickened out and felt so awkward being rude to them (especially since they didn't do anything majorly wrong) and now they think we\u2019re good again. Idk how to \u201cbreak up\u201d with them without hurting their feelings.",

            "Aswer": "Do you really have to formally break up? They did didn't do anything seriously wrong correct? You do get to choose who you spend time with for sure. My advice to spend less time with the people you don't get along with. It's not always necessary to formally \"break up\" with friends. Its better to maintain a circle of acquaintances. Some of these people are close friends, some are just friends, and some are just people you know from school. No need to formally reject anyone. Just tell this person that you're good with the people already on the group project.",
