            "Question": "Career Advice\nI have been working for Doordash about a year and a half now. I make $900-$1,000 per week after expenses, tax, gas, and food. I work 7 days a week so that means I don\u2019t have time to spend any of the money I make so that basically means I save $900-$1,000 per week. Last year I bought a 3-plex in my hometown right near main street and moved into one of the apartments. The two other apartments cover my mortgage which basically means I pay no rent. When I\u2019m working, I stay home in between orders and play video games. When I get an order, I pause my game, go deliver the order, then come back home. It\u2019s the best job I ever had, and it\u2019s the most money I\u2019ve ever made. I\u2019m 22, guy, degree in pre-med (dropped out of university), no special experience in any sector of employment, basically a nobody. \n\nBut here\u2019s my quandary, right. My family has a hard time to wrap their heads around my job. Actually, they don\u2019t even consider it a real \u201cjob\u201d. So they offered to pay for my schooling if I went and got a DEP in something. I\u2019m not complaining, it\u2019s very generous of them, so I told them I\u2019d get a DEP in electricity, signed up, got admitted, and now I start my course in about 3 months. The thing is, I keep having second thoughts about it, but I don\u2019t want to pull out because it\u2019s kind of a recurring joke that I never finish what I start and always reverse course last minute. It\u2019s just that I love my job and I\u2019m making good money but at the same time I do agree with them that getting a \u201creal\u201d job (electrician) would be to my benefit.

You said you can \u201cown up to your shit\u201d; this isn\u2019t really you causing a mess of shit in your life, though. You were on birth control (and Plan B), and it failed for whatever reason. It\u2019s an accident. It happens because that\u2019s generally what happens when people have sex; someone gets pregnant. \n\nAsk yourself: do you WANT to have a baby now? Fuck whatever sperm-donor over there says - especially the part about \u201cWE should get an abortion\u201d. HE faces no physical consequences of his ejaculation. YOU do, and if you choose to go that route, YOU will be having the abortion, not him. It\u2019s easy for him to go to this conclusion quickly because he\u2019s not the one facing the consequences of such a decision, you are. \n\nSo, circle back around: DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A BABY? You said you are financially able to support having a baby. You said you\u2019d have him sign away his rights (which does not mean he won\u2019t be paying child support, by the way; he\u2019s still financially on the hook for this), and handle things on your own. Ok, so you have the rest of the boxes checked, but do you WANT a baby? That\u2019s entirely up to you, and you\u2019ll get no judgement from me (pro-choice here, for the record).\n\nMy advice: take some time to really reflect on if you are really ready for a baby.

I live in an apartment and the neighbor\u2019s upstairs bathroom is right on top of mine so I can always hear when they run their shower/bath. Their water has been running for like legit 5 hours. No sign of flooding though (it would\u2019ve spilled down to my bathroom). Should I like call maintenance or somebody or something? Thanks!\n\nUPDATE: Sorry for the delay, after contacting police I fell asleep and it took them like a few hours to even come out and check. Neighbor is fine, they (for whatever unknown reason) left the shower on and left the house. They\u2019re not elderly, but may be mentally unwell. \n\nAnyways, shower is off now and it ran for a total of like 10 hours. Weird shit and complete waste of tons of water I\u2019m water.

            "Question": "Being pressured to buy my first home for my grandparents\nI'm 23 years old, currently living at home with my family, which includes my grandparents (in their late 80s) who live in our finished basement. My grandparents have been giving rent money to my parents from their pension ever since they bought the house. In recent years, my mother has been cooking for her parents, and also helping my grandmother with more tedious tasks (cleaning, etc.).\n\nAfter working full time this past year post-graduation, I feel confident I could buy a small property.\n\nI had been debating whether I should live in that property and pay off the full monthly mortgage OR rent it out to tenants who would pay off the big bulk of my payments.\n\nRecently, my mother approached me saying that maybe when I've saved up enough, I should buy a small townhouse and have my grandparents live with me. My grandparents would then give me rent money that I would use to pay off my mortgage, and I would be able to help them out in case of emergency. My mother would be stopping by frequently and bring food as well.\n\nThe thing is that I don't know how to feel about that. I wanted to buy a house that I would be living in either by myself or to rent out while staying at home. I always figured that my first \"big\" home purchase wouldn't be until I get married and start a family.\n\nWhile my mother is not forcing any of this burden on me, the fact that she asked me makes me feel bad for not being totally on board with it. I want to help my grandparents and my mother out, especially since the basement has had a lot of heating issues. I don't want to regret not helping out my family, but at the same time I don't want to regret spending my early-mid 20s as a caretaker for my grandparents as roommates.\n\nMy cousins, who live far away, are living their lives, either living with roommates in an apartment/townhouse or newly buying property where they live alone or with their partners. It bothers me that I get the \"short end\" of the stick, and while I can still go out on weekends and see friends, having my grandparents more close with me (and likely needing me) makes things complicated. Again, I have the final say and I'm not being forced. But I don't know how I could ever tell my mom or my grandparents that i can't do that for them (if that's what I choose).\n\nI really want to help my mom with her parents, but I don't want to sacrifice my 20s either. What should I do?",

He always tells me how important sex is for men and how they can\u2019t function without it. I can\u2019t see him as much because I\u2019ve been working a lot and I also go to school part time. He barely works and always have time on his hands. Just laying in his house. \n\nAs soon as he gets sexually frustrated he starts with his nonsense. Yesterday he told me \u201cthere\u2019s a lot of girls that\u2019s been asking me (to have sex) but I\u2019ve been turning them down, imma end up saying yes.\u201d  \n\nMind you, I\u2019ve been having his back while he\u2019s been down and out. Buying him food, giving him money, being a shoulder for him to cry on. \n\nIs this sexual manipulation? What should I do?\n\nEdit: I just wanted to add that our most recent argument was because I\u2019ve recently got over a really bad illness that left me sick for two weeks and bedridden. And he immediately started threatening me with the cheating. He told me that a women would never let her man leave the house sexually frustrated.\n\n\nUpdate: I\u2019ve broken up with him! I sent him a text telling him how I felt about everything and I used some of the stuff you guys said. I blocked him on every single social media site including regular phone. I want thank you guys for all your support and patience. You guys really helped me a lot today. I\u2019m  going to take time to just heal and worry about myself. \u2764\ufe0f",
