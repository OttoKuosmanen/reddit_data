The kicker is she was secretly married the entire time we were dating and once I found out I ended things.

I just need advice on how I can get them to switch gyms? \n\nI can't leave this job, I was so broke for so long after covid. Lost my cafe and my house.

She stood up abruptly and my hand bumped her red wine glass. It spilled all over her dress and splattered on the light grey couch and carpet. She was able to get the wine out of her dress. The host of the party had hired someone to help with drinks and cleaning during the party. At that time she acted quick and tried to scrub the wine out of the cushions. She confirmed to me she was able to get the wine out. The following day the host of the party said he was angry with me due to the red wine spill which apparently has not fully come out of the cushions or the carpet. The guest who was actually drinking the red wine confirmed she was able to get the red wine out of her dress. My question is, who is responsible for the red wine stained on the cushions and carpet?

            "Question": "My (33m) girlfriend (29f) isn\u2019t paying rent. Should I break up?\nI (33m) have been together with my gf (29f) for nearly 4 years now. She comes from a wealthy family. Well, her extended family is wealthy. Her parents are somewhere in the low 7 figures. But she never had to worry about money. Therefore she never really had a job. Sometimes she would work for her dad\u2019s company. But that would only be minor tasks. I never really worried about that because it was made clear she would take over the business and thought she\u2019d get everything together by then. At one point I got a bit annoyed that she was always at home and got her a job through a friend of mine where she works a few hours per week. \n\nI kind of became suspicious when she didn\u2019t finish her degree and confronted her about it. But she shrugged it off and told me it wasn\u2019t any of my business as long as she was able to pay rent and contribute financially to our life. Since communication is very important to me I was a bit alarmed. \n\nDuring the last year things got rocky. For reference: We split rent and costs for our dog 50/50. Since I\u2019m using her car sometimes I give her half of the leasing rate + gas. Other spendings are all from our own accounts.\n\nLast summer we went on a roadtrip where I payed for everything. Afterwards I told her the total, expecting her to pay me back. She told me she couldn\u2019t afford it, which I thought was weird. First of all because I know she got a huuuuge cheque from her dad the year before and I thought it was a bit unfair not to clarify beforehand. Since then she only payed rent sporadically. When I confronted her about it and asked her when she was gonna contribute again to our shared life I barely got an answer or she told me she couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not about the money but more about the way of not communicating about this issue. Am I expecting too much? How could I address this better? Or is this a major red flag?",

She sent him $30 via Cashapp so he can start \"processing\" a payment of $5k. He supposedly sent the $5k but there was a holding fee or transaction fee or something so she needed to send more money to release it. Well, she ended up sending $225 via Apple Pay. He claimed he didn't get any money and that she needs to fix it or else. That's when she finally came crying to me because she knew she got scammed. Shortly after, she gets this text on her phone from the \"FBI\". It was a pic of a guy holding a badge saying that they received information she was scamming someone and that she had to reach out to him to fix it or else they were coming after her and her family.

            "Question": "Friend is mad because my husband complimented her?\nA good friend of mine broke up with her boyfriend of 6 years after she discovered he was cheating. She has recently decided to get back into dating, but she wanted the first date to be a double-date for her own comfort. Her date was completely on board and they invited my husband and I. We met at a restaurant. My husband and I arrived first, and my friend showed soon after. Before her date arrived, my husband made a comment to her:\n\n*\u201cThat dress looks eloquent (edit: ELEGANT) on you. The color is unique.\u201d*\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about my husband and his family: They give compliments. It\u2019s never sexual or over-the-top, but they all will **occasionally** give nice comments to people they know/trust, regardless of gender, and they do it sensibly, in my opinion. And it\u2019s not always about appearances. It\u2019s one of the things that attracts me to him. \n\nThe dinner went well, we thought. My friend\u2019s date seemed to hit it off with her.

            "Question": "Wife cheated at the school she works in, with the janitor. What would you do?\nAs the title says, my wife of 14 years cheated on me with her schools janitor. His occupation has nothing to do with this, just that I am not naming him here.  \n\nI was devastated when I found out that this had happened. One, it happened within a couple days of meeting each other, two I learned of this relationship from my step son the day they were planning on getting a hotel room. My step son had happened to have her iPad, which gets the same messages her iPhone gets, when Janitor guy was sending duck pics to her. My step son is 14 and brought \u201cinappropriate\u201d texting to my attention, and when I saw what he saw I dove in and read everything they said to each other and every photo. I took photos of every text. 3 days is all it took to destroy 14 years. \n\nUpon further investigation she had lied about the day prior which would only have been day 2 where she said she was having to work late to complete a couple reports and a board. That day she had given the guy a hand job at the very least in the school library. I say at the very least because I can prove that with texts and what she confessed to in texts. This happened later in the day after kids have left, but it is an elementary school, middle school and high school all in one. They were in the elementary school if this matters. \n\nMy dilemma is , I am vengeful over this and can\u2019t let it go. We are getting a divorce, but this guy has been unharmed emotionally and physically. I feel I need to have him hurt to make up for my hurt and the hurt our 3 kids are going to go through because of this. This is also something I would say both of them need to stay out of places christen could be present doing this crap. After school activities happen there frequently. I am not sure if there was anything happening that day.\n\nAlso his dick has effected my step so. To the degree he runs from school at the bell and refuses to stay if he thinks he might encounter this man. He has caught his mom texting him still and has asked her to stop. He shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this. \n\nI want to turn him in for having sexual relations in a school. Or for adultery even. I can handle the fact this has happened and I need a divorce. I cannot handle the fact this will be part of the kids lives and my life and this guy gets to walk away. He needs to pay for this.\n\n*****Edit\nThank you all for the advise. I will be seeing a lawyer tomorrow to figure out what options I have. Revenge in any way would most likely cause me more issue. I\u2019m focusing on getting toxic thoughts out of my head and making sure the kids end up in the best possible situation. Which is the only part that scares the shit out of me.",

The other (23f) is always home when I'm home and has been having mental health issues lately.\n\nShe often has LOUD crying fits in her room after work.

She said she didn't care enough to clean it up.\n\nLast night, I found her self harming by jabbing the blunt end of a skewer into her thigh over and over and she had bruises everywhere. My first instinct was to grab her arm to try and take away the skewer. So I grabbed her wrist and I admit I had to grab it very hard because she was fighting me.\n\nAnd then she started screaming at me to let go so I did. She came at me and started hit my head saying I need to fuck off and mind my own business. So I was grabbing her arms again trying to calm her down.

I work 7 days a week so that means I don\u2019t have time to spend any of the money I make so that basically means I save $900-$1,000 per week. Last year I bought a 3-plex in my hometown right near main street and moved into one of the apartments. The two other apartments cover my mortgage which basically means I pay no rent. When I\u2019m working, I stay home in between orders and play video games. When I get an order, I pause my game, go deliver the order, then come back home. It\u2019s the best job I ever had, and it\u2019s the most money I\u2019ve ever made. I\u2019m 22, guy, degree in pre-med (dropped out of university), no special experience in any sector of employment, basically a nobody. \n\nBut here\u2019s my quandary, right. My family has a hard time to wrap their heads around my job. Actually, they don\u2019t even consider it a real \u201cjob\u201d. So they offered to pay for my schooling if I went and got a DEP in something. I\u2019m not complaining, it\u2019s very generous of them, so I told them I\u2019d get a DEP in electricity, signed up, got admitted, and now I start my course in about 3 months. The thing is, I keep having second thoughts about it, but I don\u2019t want to pull out because it\u2019s kind of a recurring joke that I never finish what I start and always reverse course last minute. It\u2019s just that I love my job and I\u2019m making good money but at the same time I do agree with them that getting a \u201creal\u201d job (electrician) would be to my benefit.
