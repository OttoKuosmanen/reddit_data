Most of these threats have been made towards me specifically. The school & the district wants nothing to do w/ it because he has special needs. The Board Of Education won't do anything either. He even has child p*rn on his phone, but they don't seem to care. I don't want anything horrible to happen, but nobody is taking this seriously, what do I do?!",

            "Question": "My (33m) girlfriend (29f) isn\u2019t paying rent. Should I break up?\nI (33m) have been together with my gf (29f) for nearly 4 years now. She comes from a wealthy family. Well, her extended family is wealthy. Her parents are somewhere in the low 7 figures. But she never had to worry about money. Therefore she never really had a job. Sometimes she would work for her dad\u2019s company. But that would only be minor tasks. I never really worried about that because it was made clear she would take over the business and thought she\u2019d get everything together by then. At one point I got a bit annoyed that she was always at home and I never had a second for myself and helped her getting a job through a friend of mine where she works a few hours per week. \n\nI kind of became suspicious when she didn\u2019t finish her degree and confronted her about it. But she shrugged it off and told me it wasn\u2019t any of my business as long as she was able to pay rent and contribute financially to our life. Since communication is very important to me I was a bit alarmed. \n\nDuring the last year things got rocky. For reference: We split rent and costs for our dog 50/50. Since I\u2019m using her car sometimes I give her half of the leasing rate + gas. Other spendings are all from our own accounts.\nLast summer we went on a roadtrip where I paid for everything. Afterwards I told her the total, expecting her to pay me back. She told me she couldn\u2019t afford it, which I thought was weird. First of all because I know she got a huuuuge cheque from her dad the year before and I thought it was a bit unfair not to clarify beforehand. Since then she only paid rent sporadically. When I confronted her about it and asked her when she was gonna contribute again to our shared life I barely got an answer or she told me she couldn\u2019t afford it. \nTo be clear, it\u2019s not about the money in the first place but more about the way of not communicating about this issue. Am I expecting too much? How could I address this better? Or is this a major red flag?\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: to address a few comments\n\nCommunication about finances: I was very upfront when she moved in about all costs, what and how I plan to cover/split. We discussed it multiple times. She\u2019s a passionate cook but at one point grocery spendings were getting out of hand (1k/month). We agreed on a limit. \nBut I also think there should be common sense about spending. Why would I need to clarify that I don\u2019t pay for a full vacation? Doesn\u2019t make sense to me in a relationship. In my previous relationships my partner always offered to pay her half or contribute whatever she can.\n\nCommunication emotionally: My girlfriend is a very insecure person. She\u2019d rather listens to others instead of doing the talking. In my opinion that\u2019s rooted in lack of self esteem. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to talk about emotional or uncomfortable things with her. I can see her trying though. \n\nIn her defense: She\u2019s not overall lazy. As I mentioned she\u2019s a passionate cook and kinda turned into a SAHP, likes to make everything nice at home, having guests over etc. It\u2019s just\u2026 I never asked her to do any of that. I want my partner to tell me what she\u2019s thinking about, what her goals are, difficulties, etc. Wich I told her. \nBut she totally locks me out. Guess that\u2019s why the rent thing is bothering me so much. It would have been fine for me if she would have come to me before and would have told me that she can\u2019t pay rent, why that is and what her plan is.\n\nI did talk to her about it multiple times. But I also wanna support her and not being a douche to her. And yeah, maybe I\u2019m bad at addressing this properly, because I don\u2019t wanna be too harsh.\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not after her money. My only goal is to be financially stable and independent. I like my job which won\u2019t make me rich but I\u2019ll won\u2019t struggle. But I do like her family. We get along very well.

She's probably still reeling from the aftermath of being cheated on, herself... \n\nSuppose I'd say just tell your husband that she's not taking well to compliments from men right now, unfortunately, because she's still on edge from her prior relationship. I'd then see if it could become water under the bridge, but if she starts being nasty toward your husband, then that'd merit a more stern talk that she can't be treating people poorly like that.",

            "Question": "Wife cheated at the school she works in, with the janitor. What would you do?\nAs the title says, my wife of 14 years cheated on me with her schools janitor. His occupation has nothing to do with this, just that I am not naming him here.  \n\nI was devastated when I found out that this had happened. One, it happened within a couple days of meeting each other, two I learned of this relationship from my step son the day they were planning on getting a hotel room. My step son had happened to have her iPad, which gets the same messages her iPhone gets, when Janitor guy was sending duck pics to her. My step son is 14 and brought \u201cinappropriate\u201d texting to my attention, and when I saw what he saw I dove in and read everything they said to each other and every photo. I took photos of every text. 3 days is all it took to destroy 14 years. \n\nUpon further investigation she had lied about the day prior which would only have been day 2 where she said she was having to work late to complete a couple reports and a board. That day she had given the guy a hand job at the very least in the school library. I say at the very least because I can prove that with texts and what she confessed to in texts. This happened later in the day after kids have left, but it is an elementary school, middle school and high school all in one. They were in the elementary school if this matters. \n\nMy dilemma is , I am vengeful over this and can\u2019t let it go. We are getting a divorce, but this guy has been unharmed emotionally and physically. I feel I need to have him hurt to make up for my hurt and the hurt our 3 kids are going to go through because of this. This is also something I would say both of them need to stay out of places christen could be present doing this crap. After school activities happen there frequently. I am not sure if there was anything happening that day.\n\nAlso his dick has effected my step so. To the degree he runs from school at the bell and refuses to stay if he thinks he might encounter this man. He has caught his mom texting him still and has asked her to stop. He shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this. \n\nI want to turn him in for having sexual relations in a school. Or for adultery even. I can handle the fact this has happened and I need a divorce. I cannot handle the fact this will be part of the kids lives and my life and this guy gets to walk away. He needs to pay for this.\n\n*****Edit\nThank you all for the advise. I will be seeing a lawyer tomorrow to figure out what options I have. Revenge in any way would most likely cause me more issue. I\u2019m focusing on getting toxic thoughts out of my head and making sure the kids end up in the best possible situation. Which is the only part that scares the shit out of me.",

            "Question": "nobody wants my father's cats\nmy (14f) father died almost two weeks ago. i guess i'm fine, really. \n\nbut that's not the point. \n\nmy father had two cats: a red one (who he adopted with my mom to give to my aunt, who then gave him back to the as he was always a troublemaker and fell from the sixth floor while playing), who's already old and who he took in after the divorce with my mom (he lived at mom's house before), and a stray one. we adopted her a few years ago. the red one is almost sixteen, and since he comes from a norwegian forest cats cattery he's probably not going to live for many more years, sadly. \n\nwe initially thought to give the cats to my aunt (the same one as before): she already has four cats, and her house is pretty big. she had also told my mother that she was more than happy to help. and obviously it wasn't true. even if it was, however, there would've still been a problem: my aunt's boyfriend. he's unemployed, has two kids who don't want to see him and lives with my aunt and two cousins without paying any money (which is normal, but since he's a literal failure he doesn't even do anything to help around the house. h  literally just likes to sit there and drink wine). when my aunt told him about welcoming two other cats into HER household, he complained about six cats being a big number of cats to take care for (which is also reasonable, but it's important to note that my mom had explicitly told my aunt she was going to help her buy the cats food, and other than that, again, it's not like HES the one taking care of the cats)\n\nmy aunt told my mom that my uncle (her husband) would've been more than happy to take the cats in. the problems with this are so many i don't even know where to start. first of all, my father absolutely hated my uncle, they had never gotten along  for so many reasons that aren't important right now. second of all, he's w ok known for being arrogant, and even after more than eleven years of my mom and dad taking care of it, he still considers the red cat to be his. lastly, the main reason why it would've been great to have my aunt keep the cats us that we live very near to each other, and  i go and come back from school  with my cousins: if the cats were at theirs, i could see them anytime i want (and my brother as well). \n\nthen there are my father's first wife (and my half brother) and his girlfriend. despite having declared themselves animal enthusiasts many times before, they'd just straight up said no, which theres nothing wrong, but acting like you love animals to the point where you feel like it's appropriate to tell two kids (me and my brother) are they're going to abandon their pet turtle in the pond at the park because you think they're  not able to look after it (an actual thing that my dad girlfriend said) and then decline such an offer is kind of hypocritical. \n\nmy grandma was also initially an option, but she hasn't wanted a pet ever since her cat died more than 15 years ago. \n\nat this point you're probably wondering why WE can't keep the cats (even though i'd love to). the reasons are two: \n1. my mom has a deep hatred for cats after taking care of two (red one + his late companion) troublemakers for more than ten years \n2. her boyfriends allergic to cats, and although he doesn't live sixth us he wouldn't be able to even come inside our home.\n\nas of now, the cats are still at my father's house and my father's first husband goes there to give them some food. \n\ni feel really bad because i know the only person that REALLY loved these cats was my father (although my mother has always done her best and i know taking care of two cats isn't easy and she would have to take care of them alone)\n\ni really want to have those cats near me. does anyone have any advice on how to act? i really need that right now.",
