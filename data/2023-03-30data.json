            "Question": "My husband hides my toys!! HELP!\nLet me start by saying this man has an ego problem when it comes to our sex life. He is very inconsistent with everything, down to our finances. The first time, i was looking for my toy in my drawer, and it disappeared for over 3 months. I played along with it and then called him out on it when it reappeared. \n\nMost recently we moved and I put all the contents from the drawer into my bag. I've been looking for this bag for about 2 months  and I finally found the bag and my toys are missing. \n\nI'm so sick of his subtle controlling ways. He looks for ways to take away things I enjoy that intimidate him  but does nothing to actually fix our issues. I can't speak to anyone about this because it's so embarrassing. Should I try to have a real conversation about this?\n\nUPDATE!!!: I spoke to him about it, he didn't say anything at first then he started gaslighting me. Answering questions with questions then denied taking it. He did finally admit to hiding my last toy, stating, \"because he didn't want his step-son to get to it\" which is odd because he denied it for months! These rose toys are expensive, I'm mad I have to buy a new one. FYI - we did therapy in the past. After one session, he said the therapist should focus on her problems first. Would this be grounds for divorce for you?",

And please don\u2019t think I\u2019m being over dramatic I\u2019m only sharing this incident because it\u2019s not too bad and can paint a picture. \n\nHi I\u2019m Jordan (18). Long story short I\u2019m the only \u201ccivilian\u201d (what my family calls me) in a family of people that have been in the street life at some point or another. I\u2019m confused on what to do and how to compromise. \n\nMy sister (25) recently got into a fight with this girl and when I was holding her accountable for her actions I was berated and told \u201cyou don\u2019t do that to family. It doesn\u2019t matter what happened, you should have her side no matter what\u201d. I was told I was wrong when removing myself from the situation incase a witness was needed, but then told not to tell 100% of the truth if it makes my sister look bad. \n\nI won\u2019t say exactly but through multiple situations my mom has shown me that she has no problem throwing me under the bus if it saves my sister. Which has me totally confused because I\u2019m being told that family should support each other but I\u2019m supposed to take the fall for my sister. I\u2019m supposed to lie for my sister. I\u2019m supposed to put myself in jeopardy to go to jail so that my sister can walk free. But why doesn\u2019t my family try to keep me out of that situation? Why would my family feel comfortable putting me in jail when I\u2019ve never did anything to have any run in with the police? I\u2019m told that I have a bad view of family and I should do better. My only concern is doing what\u2019s right. \n\nI\u2019ve been told by my parents that they\u2019re happy that I never got put into that kind of life but then I\u2019m almost belittled and berated for not being able to understand it. I\u2019m asked for my opinion but then yelled at and told \u201cyou\u2019ve never gone through it so you could never understand\u201c.

            "Question": "I was falsely accused of SA and it\u2019s ruining me\nI\u2019m 20 years old in college and a 30 yr old woman has tried to ruin my life, and it\u2019s worked to an extent. I met this woman through work, I thought she was nice, and she was at first. We talked often and became friends, she wanted it to evolve into something more and became infatuated with me and wanted sex, It wasn\u2019t reciprocated at alI. She showed up to my 2nd job (A grocery store) twice. I never told her where I worked. I was minding my own business working when she first showed up, I was walking to the front of the store to do some stuff and was shocked to see her, she lives 30 mins away from where I work so I didn\u2019t know why she was here at my store. She saw me see her and walked up to me and said \u201cHey! How are you? I\u2019m just on my break\u201d and i\u2019m thinking\u2026 why are you on your break here?? It was very awkward and I told her I was busy and needed to go so I left. The 2nd time she showed up, I had just clocked out and was getting ready to leave the store when I suddenly ran into her on my way out. She was \u201cshopping\u201d and was trying to strike up conversation. The first time was already weird af and I was beyond creeped out at this point. I told her I was busy again and needed to be on my way. One day when I wasn\u2019t working, I checked my snap map to see if she was there, she was. \n\nWhenever I\u2019d take a while to respond to her texts she would post on her snap story and make it private so that only I would see it and title the story \u201cJason pls pls pls read\u201d (jason isn\u2019t my real name but you get the idea). She showed up to my house one time with gifts I didn\u2019t ask for, it was some merch from my favorite shows and some cheep wish.com clothes. She\u2019d post pictures of me to her instagram and would caption it cringey shit like \u201c#mr.sideprofile\u201d I never asked her to do that, she just did. Overtime her texts to me became increasingly explicit. The final straw was when she asked me to \u201cfuck her savagely\u201d after that I said she was really creepy and blocked her on everything. I could\u2019ve done that ages ago before it got extreme and I should have but that doesn\u2019t make what she did okay. \n\nAfter I blocked her she tried emailing me multiple times through different accounts and started texting my friends and was playing the victim saying \u201che blocked me and i don\u2019t know why\ud83e\udd7a\u201d my friends told me and asked me who this was and i explained everything to them, after which they told her to fuck off. For a couple days that was it, not much happened with her. \n\nOne the first day of the semester at a new school I transferred to, I get a call from campus police, saying I need to talk with them. I meet up in an office with some office worker and a cop. They told me about some comments that were made on the school\u2019s instagram. They showed me a printout of it. It was a bunch of sock puppet accounts commenting on posts saying that I was a rapist and have sexually assaulted many people. I knew instantly it was her doing. She didn\u2019t even do a good job of hiding it. All the accounts names were from things she knew I liked. One was \u201ccorpse bride casting\u201d and another was \u201cstarplatinum_gold47\u201d They were all references to shows and movies i liked. Luckily I had screenshots of her trying to ask me for sex and other weird crazy shit she did. After i showed them all that and explained who she was, they believed me and said they would open a case against her, nothing ever came of it though and it was eventually closed because apparently the cop couldn\u2019t get in contact with her. The comments were the last thing she did and it\u2019s been quiet from her. The damage had been done though. My reputation was fucked. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times i\u2019ve had to explain to people i\u2019m not a rapist. It doesn\u2019t always work. My peers would talk about it and try to warn people of me. I tried asking the faculty to do something about it but they don\u2019t do shit. \n\nI\u2019m tired and angry all the time. I want to be normal. I want to take action. I don\u2019t want to live like this anymore. I\u2019m so tired of being made out to be a monster. I\u2019m not. I want people to leave me alone and let me live. \n\nPlease offer your advice on how I can deal this. Anything would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",

He\u2019s sweet, kind and he treats me with respect, he\u2019s always complimenting me and saying how lucky he is to have me. \n\nYesterday I got to see a side of him I didn\u2019t know existed, and what happened left me in shock. We both study at the same uni and yesterday we met in the library, we were the only two people there at the time. I rushed to get to the library and so I was pretty sweaty. I was wearing a tank top under my long sleeve shirt and so I removed my shirt, since I was getting hot. \n\nAs soon as he saw me wearing a tank top he immediately removed his hoodie and gave it to me, saying \u201ccover up, now\u201d. Needless to say I thought he was joking, since he never showed any signs of being \u201cconservative\u201d or whatever you want to call it, and is supportive of women in general. \n\nHe started saying that I\u2019m inappropriate and I shouldn\u2019t be there wearing a tank top (remind you: we were the only two people present) I lack decor and I should cover up because I\u2019m disrespecting the entire university and my teachers\u2019 job by exposing my shoulders apparently.

We talked a little about it and he firmly believes that society\u2019s rules should be respected, but every time I questioned him about him blindly following what others say he didn\u2019t even know how to reply, he just said that if most people believe in something then it must be right, zero critical thinking skills. \n\nHe apologized for telling me to cover up but also told me that these are his morals and he\u2019s probably not willing to change them. \n\nI\u2019m starting to believe I never knew him at all and I feel uncomfortable, but I also care about him and don\u2019t want to end the relationship for one argument.

The kicker is she was secretly married the entire time we were dating and once I found out I ended things. The problem is that every week Monday to Friday at 7:30am to 9am I see her and her new boyfriend that she cheated on me (and is currently cheating on her husband with) at the gym. I thought I could handle it but I can't. I flat out ignore them both but hearing their voices first thing in the morning almost every morning is painful. I just need advice on how I can get them to switch gyms? \n\nI can't leave this job, I was so broke for so long after covid. Lost my cafe and my house. And now I'm finally working again earning a very good salary and building my life back up. I just moved to this new town mid last year as well so I have no where else to go. Any advice please help",

I didn\u2019t have any plant based milk in the house so they brought a container with a little bit of oat milk in it so they could have a cup of tea here. They accidentally left that container and the milk went bad so I threw it away and washed the container.\nWe were chatting about oat milk and they mentioned how expensive it is. I know that it\u2019s fairly easy to make your own and was wondering if it would be weird if I gave them their container back with some homemade oat milk in it? Or is that too odd? I\u2019m like 80% sure they would appreciate it but the 20% is shouting loudly that it\u2019s too weird so I\u2019d love some opinions please!",

Even my tv, couch, dresser, my collectable cars that I adore. I am behind by a lot of money but right now I am in urgent need of about $300. I can usually do food delivery to catch up but my car needs a small repair first (I can do myself just need the part) and I have a negative account balance. I am looking for cash jobs as well as regular jobs. It's very hard to find a strictly daytime job as a single mother. I have had people reach out online to offer me cash jobs usually in construction or something of the like, but when they meet me and find out I'm a woman they doubt my strength and don't call me back. I am in Ontario, Canada. I did s*x work before but it was really scary and bad and they make me bleed all the time and I rather die than do that again. Maybe that is what I have to do but I want to know if there's other ideas.",

            "Aswer": "Another idea. Contact your local nuclear power plant and ask to be trained as a firewatch for the next outage. You can even get sent to operations school if you have a general education diploma. No worries if you do not though, firewatch pays well.\n\nBy the way, if you are curious. This kind of basic job nets about 1k dollars per week for about 2-3 months. And if you choose to stay and they send you to the nuclear operator academy you'll be making roughly 80 thousand dollars per year. It requires 18 months of training and they will ship you most likely to the capital of your country. But I'm sure there are on campus accommodations for parents with children.",

            "Question": "My (33m) girlfriend (29f) isn\u2019t paying rent. Should I break up?\nI (33m) have been together with my gf (29f) for nearly 4 years now. She comes from a wealthy family. Well, her extended family is wealthy. Her parents are somewhere in the low 7 figures. But she never had to worry about money. Therefore she never really had a job. Sometimes she would work for her dad\u2019s company. But that would only be minor tasks. I never really worried about that because it was made clear she would take over the business and thought she\u2019d get everything together by then. At one point I got a bit annoyed that she was always at home and I never had a second for myself and helped her getting a job through a friend of mine where she works a few hours per week. \n\nI kind of became suspicious when she didn\u2019t finish her degree and confronted her about it. But she shrugged it off and told me it wasn\u2019t any of my business as long as she was able to pay rent and contribute financially to our life. Since communication is very important to me I was a bit alarmed. \n\nDuring the last year things got rocky. For reference: We split rent and costs for our dog 50/50. Since I\u2019m using her car sometimes I give her half of the leasing rate + gas. Other spendings are all from our own accounts.\nLast summer we went on a roadtrip where I paid for everything. Afterwards I told her the total, expecting her to pay me back. She told me she couldn\u2019t afford it, which I thought was weird. First of all because I know she got a huuuuge cheque from her dad the year before and I thought it was a bit unfair not to clarify beforehand. Since then she only paid rent sporadically. When I confronted her about it and asked her when she was gonna contribute again to our shared life I barely got an answer or she told me she couldn\u2019t afford it. \nTo be clear, it\u2019s not about the money in the first place but more about the way of not communicating about this issue. Am I expecting too much? How could I address this better? Or is this a major red flag?\n\n\n\n\nUpdate: to address a few comments\n\nCommunication about finances: I was very upfront when she moved in about all costs, what and how I plan to cover/split. We discussed it multiple times. She\u2019s a passionate cook but at one point grocery spendings were getting out of hand (1k/month). We agreed on a limit. \nBut I also think there should be common sense about spending. Why would I need to clarify that I don\u2019t pay for a full vacation? Doesn\u2019t make sense to me in a relationship. In my previous relationships my partner always offered to pay her half or contribute whatever she can.\n\nCommunication emotionally: My girlfriend is a very insecure person. She\u2019d rather listens to others instead of doing the talking. In my opinion that\u2019s rooted in lack of self esteem. That\u2019s why it\u2019s hard to talk about emotional or uncomfortable things with her. I can see her trying though. \n\nIn her defense: She\u2019s not overall lazy. As I mentioned she\u2019s a passionate cook and kinda turned into a SAHP, likes to make everything nice at home, having guests over etc. It\u2019s just\u2026 I never asked her to do any of that. I want my partner to tell me what she\u2019s thinking about, what her goals are, difficulties, etc. Wich I told her. \nBut she totally locks me out. Guess that\u2019s why the rent thing is bothering me so much. It would have been fine for me if she would have come to me before and would have told me that she can\u2019t pay rent, why that is and what her plan is.\n\nI did talk to her about it multiple times. But I also wanna support her and not being a douche to her. And yeah, maybe I\u2019m bad at addressing this properly, because I don\u2019t wanna be too harsh.\n\nAnd no, I\u2019m not after her money. My only goal is to be financially stable and independent. I like my job which won\u2019t make me rich but I\u2019ll won\u2019t struggle. But I do like her family. We get along very well.

            "Question": "Red wine spilled at a party who\u2019s responsible\nI was sitting next to a friend at a small party and she was drinking red wine. She stood up abruptly and my hand bumped her red wine glass. It spilled all over her dress and splattered on the light grey couch and carpet. She was able to get the wine out of her dress. The host of the party had hired someone to help with drinks and cleaning during the party. At that time she acted quick and tried to scrub the wine out of the cushions. She confirmed to me she was able to get the wine out. The following day the host of the party said he was angry with me due to the red wine spill which apparently has not fully come out of the cushions or the carpet. The guest who was actually drinking the red wine confirmed she was able to get the red wine out of her dress. My question is, who is responsible for the red wine stained on the cushions and carpet? I said the person he hired confirmed to me she was able to get the stains out of the cushions at that moment. The host is insinuating that I should pay to replace the cushions, which are apparently not even available for purchase anymore. Who is responsible?",
