He wants to start a family and I'm not comfortable with that because we've only been together for 2 months. I moved out of mom's house (she was abusive ) around 2 months ago as well and moved in with him then we started dating.

Use this time now to get him to tell his stories, and record them so that you can write them down for his grandkids to enjoy.\n\nYour dad is going to lose his ability to swallow, and will eventually need a feeding tube.  So cook what he loves, take him out to restaurants he loves, and order in food he loves, while you can.\n\nYour dad is going to lose his mobility, and navigating the world in a wheelchair (especially a power chair, which he is likely going to eventually need) is anything but easy.  So if there are places he likes to go, do it now while you still can.  Your dad is going to tire easily and anything you plan for him needs to account for that.",

            "Question": "My mom has kept $30k in child support money and plans on using it to buy herself a house.\nFor context, I, recently turned 18, and have always lived with my mom since my parents split up when I was around 11. I was never the closest to my dad growing up, but as I got older, that slowly changed. \n\nRecently my divorced parents got into an argument over how much my dad was giving as child support money. He was giving a large sum per month and my mom was arguing that it wasn't enough and she needed even more. She claimed that she needed to cover my wifi, water + electric bill, phone bill, a $500 monthly credit card, my insurances, etc., and that all added up to well over what he was giving her.  \n\nAfter hearing about this, I spoke to my dad directly about it all and listened to all he had to say, his concerns, why the conversation came up, and in my opinion, it was all fair. He has his own life and other things going on obviously, and this whole argument had started because he was thinking about lowering the amount that he would be giving as child support. He had suggested cutting it in half and was asking for a full breakdown of how much my \"monthly expenses\" were in order to figure out if what he was considering giving would still be plenty. Low and behold, it was, way more even. As I mentioned, I recently turned 18 and am a legal adult, there technically speaking is no longer a requirement for him to even continuing offering me aid financially and I am very much grateful for whatever amount I can get, especially since I plan on attending college and moving out of my moms house as soon as possible. \n\nNow for the main issue: In the midst of this debate, after I figured out that my bills weren't anywhere close to what my dad was giving me, I asked my mom where the rest of the money was. She says that she had actually been pocketing the money in hopes of using it as a down payment to a house for \"us\" in a outskirt city a few hours away where I do not want to live. As the title suggests, she racked up about $30k. \n\nI've made it clear to her that I'm moving out and don't want to live in that city at any point, but that's where she wants a house. So now my concern and what'd I'd like advice with is if I'm wrong for feeling like that money should be going to me and not to her potential house? In my mind I sound like an A-hole for even believing it but from what I remember there really was no mention of this money until I found out about it. She claims that she's mentioned it several times before but I honestly am not sure if I remember her bringing it up or not. \n\nI'd also like to make it known that I do not like to talk to my mom about things like this because anytime I do, I end up feeling like the bad guy. For example, the moment I sat down to talk to her about the expenses, she started yelling and saying I'm just like my dad and that if I want to act like him I can just go live with him. \n\nI don't intend on spending the money or going crazy with this huge amount, but college is right around the corner and being able to pay that off fairly easily sounds really good to me. I also have to pay my dad $5k back for my car that he helped me purchase; I currently have two jobs while in high school to ensure I have enough money to support myself, but Im just worrying too much about the near-coming future?\n\nSo again, am I wrong for thinking that I should be able to use that money for my college? What should I do about this situation? Feel free to ask any extra questions for more information.",

I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d ever have to experience this, or at least not any time soon. I\u2019m so embarrassed and don\u2019t even know what to say to him.  I\u2019m kind of just hiding in my room at this point. I\u2019ve already given him talks about safe sex, and the importance of contraceptive. I just feel more awkward then here. What do I even do?

            "Question": "I was falsely accused of SA and it\u2019s ruining me\nI\u2019m 20 years old in college and a 30 yr old woman has tried to ruin my life, and it\u2019s worked to an extent. I met this woman through work, I thought she was nice, and she was at first. We talked often and became friends, she wanted it to evolve into something more and became infatuated with me and wanted sex, It wasn\u2019t reciprocated at alI. She showed up to my 2nd job (A grocery store) twice. I never told her where I worked. I was minding my own business working when she first showed up, I was walking to the front of the store to do some stuff and was shocked to see her, she lives 30 mins away from where I work so I didn\u2019t know why she was here at my store. She saw me see her and walked up to me and said \u201cHey! How are you? I\u2019m just on my break\u201d and i\u2019m thinking\u2026 why are you on your break here?? It was very awkward and I told her I was busy and needed to go so I left. The 2nd time she showed up, I had just clocked out and was getting ready to leave the store when I suddenly ran into her on my way out. She was \u201cshopping\u201d and was trying to strike up conversation. The first time was already weird af and I was beyond creeped out at this point. I told her I was busy again and needed to be on my way. One day when I wasn\u2019t working, I checked my snap map to see if she was there, she was. \n\nWhenever I\u2019d take a while to respond to her texts she would post on her snap story and make it private so that only I would see it and title the story \u201cJason pls pls pls read\u201d (jason isn\u2019t my real name but you get the idea). She showed up to my house one time with gifts I didn\u2019t ask for, it was some merch from my favorite shows and some cheep wish.com clothes. She\u2019d post pictures of me to her instagram and would caption it cringey shit like \u201c#mr.sideprofile\u201d I never asked her to do that, she just did. Overtime her texts to me became increasingly explicit. The final straw was when she asked me to \u201cfuck her savagely\u201d after that I said she was really creepy and blocked her on everything. I could\u2019ve done that ages ago before it got extreme and I should have but that doesn\u2019t make what she did okay. \n\nAfter I blocked her she tried emailing me multiple times through different accounts and started texting my friends and was playing the victim saying \u201che blocked me and i don\u2019t know why\ud83e\udd7a\u201d my friends told me and asked me who this was and i explained everything to them, after which they told her to fuck off. For a couple days that was it, not much happened with her. \n\nOne the first day of the semester at a new school I transferred to, I get a call from campus police, saying I need to talk with them. I meet up in an office with some office worker and a cop. They told me about some comments that were made on the school\u2019s instagram. They showed me a printout of it. It was a bunch of sock puppet accounts commenting on posts saying that I was a rapist and have sexually assaulted many people. I knew instantly it was her doing. She didn\u2019t even do a good job of hiding it. All the accounts names were from things she knew I liked. One was \u201ccorpse bride casting\u201d and another was \u201cstarplatinum_gold47\u201d They were all references to shows and movies i liked. Luckily I had screenshots of her trying to ask me for sex and other weird crazy shit she did. After i showed them all that and explained who she was, they believed me and said they would open a case against her, nothing ever came of it though and it was eventually closed because apparently the cop couldn\u2019t get in contact with her. The comments were the last thing she did and it\u2019s been quiet from her. The damage had been done though. My reputation was fucked. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times i\u2019ve had to explain to people i\u2019m not a rapist. It doesn\u2019t always work. My peers would talk about it and try to warn people of me. I tried asking the faculty to do something about it but they don\u2019t do shit. \n\nI\u2019m tired and angry all the time. I want to be normal. I want to take action. I don\u2019t want to live like this anymore. I\u2019m so tired of being made out to be a monster. I\u2019m not. I want people to leave me alone and let me live. \n\nPlease offer your advice on how I can deal this. Anything would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",
