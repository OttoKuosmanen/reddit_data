I (M16) have been dating my partner (FTM16) for a little over half a year. He was my girlfriend up until about two weeks ago, when he came out to me as a transgender\nmale.\n\nNow for as long as I've been living, I've been a straight man. There are times when I've questioned it, but it's always ended up with me liking girls. So when he came out, I was proud of him, but also confused as to what that would entail with our relationship. I decided I would give myself the day to think about it and I came to the conclusion that it would be disrespectful for me to be with him because I believe he deserves someone who wants to date a boy, and I don't.\n\nI\u2019m thinking about waiting a couple days before talking with him, as he just came out and I really don\u2019t want to take this step in life away from him.

If you are tight on money and $65 is a big deal then ask her for it in a week. If she doesn't pay it take her off the shared plan and let the whole thing go.",

When we do we always exchange a \u201chello\u201d but I am a very shy person and I can tell he is too. When we see each other, we say \u201cHi, How are you\u201d then we both say good and that\u2019s the end of the conversation\u2026.ughh! I have a feeling that he wants to say more and I of course do too but what do I even say after that? I\u2019m so bad at starting a random conversation/friendship. Any suggestions welcomed!",

            "Question": "My neighbours keep having loud sex, what do I do?\nThere\u2019s a couple that live next door to me, I\u2019ve talked to them a few times and the guy seems like an extremely shy person so I only smile as a greeting now.\n\nThe thing is though, every night I can hear him (and a few times her) practically screaming (and not the bad kind) and It\u2019s REALLY messing with my sleep. I\u2019m an athlete and have to train at 4-5am, 2-3 hours before going to uni, training again, then working. \n\nI really don\u2019t want to embarrass him but don\u2019t know how to approach the situation.  Does anyone know what I could do? They only seem to be home at night too, and that\u2019s when I\u2019m trying to sleep or I\u2019m trying to study.\n\n**Update**: Okay so I may have not used the most useful technique but my friend was over and I showed him this post, a couple hours later when they started he *yelled* \u201cyes mommy\u201d without warning and they stopped immediately. Pin drop silence.\n\nThanks for the replies though, I\u2019ll use the more rational approach if it happens again \ud83e\udd23",

People often talk about depression in relation to a lack of interest in activities and this is the part exactly that I believe causes it. \n\nIf this sounds like her she needs to work on being present during activities and not in her head. Activities are never fun if you're in your head worrying over how you appear or contemplating what you'll do for the rest of your day. I made this mistake my entire life. The only thing that I could do to be present during an activity was play video games or read. I never considered why I liked those things I was just grateful I did like them and found relief when doing them. Now I understand it's because I gave them my undivided attention. Since focusing on that and putting forth the effort in other activities my interests have become endless.",

            "Question": "My classmate wants me to give up my bed for her\n I (16F) am going on a 3 day trip with my school. I was lucky enough to get a room with my two best friends. However a group of 4girls at my school weren't able to get a room to themselves, 3of them were roomed together and the 1 that was left got put in a different room. She however doesn't want to sleep in the room that she was assigned. \n My room will have a twin bed and a king bed. The girl suggested that me and my 2 friends squeeze in the king bed while she gets the other one for herself. I find it unfair and my friends agree because the girl doesn't want to sleep with her twin sister and friend, in a room that has the exact same layout and space while she expects us to do so. \n  I originally said yes to her sleeping in our room on the condition that she slept on the couch (provided there is one) but she said that she paid for the trip and it's not fair to sleep on the couch while she paid for a bed. I've already thought about what to say to her but I'm afraid she is going to insist and end up ruining our trip. \nIs there anything i should say to her to shut her up immediately?????\n\nTLDR: My classmate wants me and my 2 friends to sleep in the same bed, while she gets one to herself and refuses to share with her twin sister and best friend.",
