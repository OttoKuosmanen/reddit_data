            "Question": "Neighbor called police on me for staying indoors too much\nI work from home, and before this happened thought I went outside a regular amount. I've been doing errands related to stuff around the house since I moved here 3 months ago, pretty routinely, and went out (and back) several times in the last day alone for several things. I check the mail nearly every day. I put the trash and recycling out. I get groceries and packages delivered constantly, have had furniture delivered, and have mowers who come regularly.\n\nYet this morning a police officer came, and apparently a neighbor \"hasn't seen anyone come or go for weeks.\"\n\nI didn't introduce myself to my neighbors when I moved here because, well, I'm shy.\n\nIs a neighbor watching me so intently that their inability to peg a 9-5 schedule for me made them suspicious? Am I missing something?",

            "Question": "My son\u2019s father wants to \u201ccome back into his life. \u201c\n&#x200B;\n\nSo I divorced my husband when my son was six years old (he is 19 now), and from then, his father didn\u2019t bother to spend time with him. It was pretty tough because I decided to learn some \u201cboyish\u201c activities, such as surfing, fishing, and hunting, so that I could sort of be like a father to my son and engage with him in a certain type of \u201cson and father activities. \u201c I never liked any of those, but I did them for my son, so it was tough to raise him, and the fact that his father didn\u2019t even spend the weekends with him made it worse. So my son was diagnosed with leukemia recently. His father found out (not like I was trying to hide it from him, but I didn\u2019t tell him myself because I knew that it wouldn\u2019t help in any way.), so today he called me and told me, \u201cI want to be a part of his life, I always loved him, you we\u2019re the only thing which kept me from my son. \u201c \n\nSo to make things clear: when I was 21, and his father found out I was pregnant, he insisted on an abortion, and I refused to do it, and he got outraged and emotionally blackmailed me, later when we married (he was from a strict Christian family so he begged me to marry him because his parents would \u201ckill him\u201c) (and no his parents didn\u2019t know that he wanted me to abort my son, they would be pretty mad if they ever found out), so when my son was born he started to cheat regularly. Eventually, it led to divorce, and I started raising my son alone, with zero support. And no, I never stood against him meeting his father. I begged him to spend time with him, but he didn\u2019t; he married the person he used to cheat on me with, had kids, and never even wanted to recognize his son as his\u2019s. At this point, I don\u2019t know what to do; my son has cancer, and meeting his father and finding the truth would be tough. He is already going through lots of stuff, and \u201creconnecting\u201d with his father would worsen it. So I don\u2019t know if I should let him into my son\u2019s life\u2026",

            "Aswer": "I will start by saying that your ex-husband has failed as a father. If he truly wanted to see his child, he would have tried. If you were keeping him from seeing his son, which I doubt, there is a legal process he could go through for visitation.\n\nAs for letting him into your son's life, unfortunately it's really not up to you anymore to decide. Your son is 19 and is recognized as a legal adult in most countries. So, in this situation it's up to him to decide if he wants to give his father a chance. The best thing you can do is be open and honest with your son about how you feel about his father. I hate to say this but your ex sounds highly manipulative and might try to make you look like the bad guy if they do meet so be prepared for that.\n\nGood luck.",

I hadn't told my boyfriend yet when he asked me to talk.\n\nHe sat me down and told me that he couldn't stay silent any longer. He says he can't support me in changing my face and skin \"without any good reason\". Also he thinks I am \"risking my life for nothing\" and \"ruining myself, when I'm a perfectly normal and beautiful girl\".\n\nHonestly I was crying by that point, then he asked me if I didn't think that he likes me and why his opinion worth less than the opinion of random people. I told him that I know he loves me, but I couldn't answer the second question.\n\nHe was happy to hear I had delayed the surgeries, since he doesn't want to break up, but he can't promise me he could love the new me.\n\nKnowing all this, I don't think I will have the surgeries done. I love my boyfriend more than I dislike my looks. He is now helping me to find a good therapist that helps me to feel better.",

When we first met I was so in love with him and I desired him all the time. As we got older and life started happening the desire has went away. Things changed after I became pregnant.

I'm gonna call the hotel to ask in advance if there's any way to accommodate for potential noise, and if not, then I'll just tell my bf to keep our more intense stuff for another time when we can make noise. Also, I should've mentioned originally, but this isn't a regular hotel, it's a spa hotel for couples, there will not be any children there. Also, a lot of people called me inconsiderate for making this post, im sorry I came off that way. Actually, my intention was to be as considerate as possible. I would've loved to have a super kinky mini vacation at a romantic hotel with my bf, but my first concern above all else was how I could make sure I don't bother anyone else because I know that the things we do can be very loud. But I've never been to a hotel like this before, so I wasn't sure if there was a way to work around it, which is why I asked.

In this sushi bar the waiter always gives you chop sticks and fork or spoon at the same time. We finally had our food and started to eat. As always, when eating sushi I took chop sticks and started to eat. I didn't even realize that she wasn't eating but just stared at me or my hand. I asked her if she was okay and she said, \"Yes, but, why are you eating with chop sticks?\" It caught me off guard and I just said that I always use them when I eat sushi, I supposed it's normal. \"But you can't even use them properly, nor you're asian. It just seems a bit disrespectful to me.\" I was in total shock sitting there and be like, is she serious? I know how to use chop sticks by the way... She also said it all with a really judging face as if I was a kid or something and then started to eat as if nothing happened and didn't look at me. I tried to talk about it asking her why it seemed disrespectful to her, I genuinely wanted to know cause I educate myself about other cultures/racism and want to be respectful but no one told me before that using chop sticks while not being asian is bad. Also the irony is that she isn't asian ether, she is half black, half white. After my questions she just told me that I should educate myself, think about the privilege I have and should not appropriate other cultures. Oh my... The rest of the dinner was really awkward, I tried to initiate conversations but it always ended up with some small talks. After we ended eating and paid, she thanked me for the time and went home, I did too. \n\nWhat do you think about it? I just don't know what to actually think. Is it really disrespectful? If there are asian people from countries where chop sticks are used, say what do you think about it. Thank you for reading.\n\nUPDATE: Thank you everyone for the comments. I'm glad that I didn't do anything wrong and the situation was just some bad luck person. Next time would respond her with more confidence! Sorry for my grammar by the way.",

            "Question": "Muslim coworkers want to report me for eating at my desk\nI do know what Ramadan is, but as I\u2019m not Muslim I don\u2019t know when it is. No one mentioned anything about Ramadan or anything about food in the workplace recently. Prior to today, I\u2019ve noticed many coworkers eat at their desk, including the Muslim ones. Today was a busy day for me so i ate at my desk (i don\u2019t do this often) as i couldn\u2019t leave for lunch, i had too much work and i was hungry so i ate at my desk. Someone loudly said \u201cew it smells like food in here. I\u2019m gonna send an email to HR\u201d and everybody looked at me as I\u2019m the only one eating. Now, i will stop eating at my desk during Ramadan and i would not have done it in the first place if anyone would have told me something. Now I\u2019m feeling terrible because I\u2019m being reported for something I didn\u2019t know i wasn\u2019t supposed to do and everybody knows it. After she loudly said that and everyone looked at me, i threw my food in the trash and immediately went outside to catch a breather, im so embarrassed and i feel terrible. Is there anything i can do to make sure it\u2019s clear that i didn\u2019t know and i won\u2019t be doing it again?",

            "Question": "Do I choose my best friend or my girlfriend\nHello I\u2019ve been in a committed relationship ship for almost 3 years now, everything has been solid in those 3 years with the ocasional up and downs, but as of recently something came up and I\u2019m at a crossroad. My best friend of 5 years has recently converted to Christianity, alongside of that he also is a very outspoken conservative, one of the things he is very open about is gay people not being mentally right. Which I don\u2019t agree with but it\u2019s something we don\u2019t really talk about because we have many more non-political things we share in common, how this connects to my girlfriend is she is a semi openly biesexual girl, she hates my friend because of the things he has said before,  as of recently she\u2019s asked for me to distance myself from him and stop being his friend. What should I do ?",
