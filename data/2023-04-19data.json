            "Question": "What is the best way to break up with a live in gf of nine years?\nMyself ( M, 32) and my gf (F, 33) have been together nine years.\n\n4 years ago we moved to her hometown , because she said she wants to live by her family and start a family there. We have been waiting for me to have a a higher paying job before me proposing.\n\nShe makes more money than myself. With living in the expensive area her family lives, I struggle to make ends means especially as we split everything 50/50 and in situations where I cannot she has an excel sheet to keep track of it.\n\nOver the past 4 years, I have tried really hard to fit it, but I am miserable. I hate that place and would rather live somewhere with more simple people and some nature.\n\nI recently got a huge pay upgrade, and I thought that this would make me happier. It only made me more miserable because I realized it was not the finances that were making me unhappy, its the location.\n\nShe is very clear that she would only live in that town.\n\nI want to break up but I am really struggling with the logistics. We live together and I also cannot leave my job abruptly because I want to keep a good relationship with them.\n\nI have no support system and no where I can stay because we live by her childhood friends and entire family.\n\nI am also terrified she will hate me. I feel so bad that I will be walking away after nine years and I know she is expecting an engagement and marriage, and babies in the coming two years.\n\nAny advice would be so helpful please!",

I was told that my hobby is lame and that no one in their 30s does this as they claim its childish. Is it really that childish ?? How can I deal with people insulting me ??",

            "Question": "If a friend asked me for a small art favor, and I didn't want to profit from it is it appropriate to ask them to cover the cost of supplies?\n***This doesn't apply to gifts, nor to professional exchange for profit***\n\nSay your friend is working on a project and they decide that an illustration would really make it come together. They can't find a royalty free piece of clipart or a stock image that would fit, so they go to you and ask for a one-off favor. There is a mutual understanding that neither party wants to profit from this exchange. This doesn't apply to gifts(charity), nor to professional favors which would be public or for profit. Is a favor for a favor, instead of paying for professional art you're going to make it for them, and exchange they're going to do something small instead of paying full price.\n\n**Edit: because people are misunderstanding, this is coming from a real life situation. I offered to make my friend this art for free, and they refused to let me do it for free. They told me to come up with a favor for a favor in the middle, and I wanted to know what was reasonable. Friend does not want art for free!** ***Friend does not want art for free!*** Favor for a favor, not favor for ***free!***it felt weird to talk about the personal side of it in public. I autistic and I don't always do a good job picking out what information is and isn't important to context, so I'm sorry if you got confused. I really just need to know what the hell favor means I what the fuck I'm supposed to do about that. Are these good exchanges?\n\nArt supplies are expensive sometimes, and digging into my personal supply will take away from my ability to work on personal projects later on. It would also be bad if I ran out of supplies while working on the project for them. So, in the spirit of fairness would it be appropriate to ask them to meet even with you by covering the cost of those supplies?\n\nIn traditional work this might look like asking your friend to give you enough money to buy a crowquil, ink and pad of vellum or a number two round brush just in case they needed to be replaced. Digitally, it might look like paying for a month of your Adobe subscription to make sure you don't lose access to the program you need.\n\nWould this be appropriate? Also, any other ideas?\n\nEdit:\n\nTo quote my friend, \"don't you dare do it as a gift, you gotta come up with something.\"they want to help me because I'm helping them, the goal being to soften the blow of a net negative or break even. \n\nI'm not saying that your advice isn't good advice, I just don't appreciate the advice with the side helping of judgments towards my personal character. You guys are making a lot of assumptions about my behavior and expectations. It's a request, it's optional, asking for a favor for a favor. if they can't chip in, then they can't chip in! I would still make them the illustration regardless because they're my friend. This isn't an exchange of goods of services, it's not conditional like that. When I said I didn't want to profit, I meant it. Read the top of the post, favor for a favor. It's not a gift, and it's not a transactional(professional)exchange.\n\nThere's also an assumption going around that I'm going to make my friend pay for all the examples as though they were an itemized bill. NO! Of course not. \"Just in case they needed to be replaced,\" means I'm only asking them for help with tools I'm using for their illustration, and tools I expect that may soon run out.\n\nDigital painting program subscriptions are a limited, finite resource. You rent your canvas and tools for 30 days, and within that time you'll make a few paintings. If you pay $20, and you make five paintings, that's $4 per painting. I would see that the same as 30 sheets of paper. Of those 30 days, only a fraction of that is actually usable hours, so the resource is scarcer than you'd think. I'm not a professional artist, I'm a hobbyist, so I pay for the entire cost of that program up front. Saying that digital art costs me nothing to make is categorically false and using that your justification that I'm being unreasonable is not a valid argument.",

I just went to a bachelorette party where I knew the airBnB would be covered by the brides mom. The maid of Honor (MOH) organized the trip, where we would go to dinner, and rented a car for us to drive to a hike. She also picked up some food for snacks over the weekend and one dinner.\n\nBackground: I just graduated from grad school and got a job (yay) but it doesn\u2019t pay amazing and I am still by no means rich. \n\nWe went to very nice dinners when we were there but I figured, hey since I wasn\u2019t paying for the Airbnb I would be ok. \n\nSo when I got a venmo request for $350 I was a little stunned. It was for the rental car, gas, food + alcohol, and a $70/day pool heating fee I didn\u2019t know I would be on the hook for. If I knew about it I would have told her i wouldn\u2019t pay for it. Also she charged us for the decorations she put up. \n\nAlso We ended up leaving over half the snacks and liquor she bought in the Airbnb and a steak we didn\u2019t cook. Also I\u2019m a pescatarian so I didn\u2019t eat any of the steak she did cook!!\n\nI am going to pay what she asks I think and I learned a HUGE lesson about asking about costs up front. That is my main takeaway from this. \n\n\nMy main ask for advice is if I should say anything to her? Is it worth asking to not pay for the steak at the very least? Not to mention the pool heating fee and rental car stuff. Will that make more problems later on down the line? \n\nI want to talk to the bride about it but I idk if that is a good idea either\u2026 \n\nAny advice is welcome on what I should do next. \n\nThanks\n\nEdit:\n\nApparently I did not make this clear but this is NOT including the dinners + lunches we went to which were VERY fancy ($88 one night for me + $114 the other night. Including me helping pay for bride)\n\nSo for rental car + gas + Airbnb pool+ decorations + groceries for 2.5 days she is saying she spent $1400. Which she is splitting amongst 4 of us.",

Our parents give us allowances till we start earning on our own. It's completely normal and we will do the same for our children. \n\nThe thing is, I come from a financially comfortable family. He.... doesn't. \n\nI get my fixed amount of  allowance at the start of every month, positively. His family sends him money when they can, not even a fixed amount. \n\nSo most of the time, he's completely broke. \n\nSo I'm the one who pays for his coffee, his lunch, our dates.. everyday I'm spending money for the both of us. He does \"try\" to pay me back when he gets his allowance.. but his allowance is just too less. \n\nToday, on his birthday, our friend circle went out for dinner. Since it was his birthday, the dinner was supposed to be on him. It is the way things work here. But since he had no money, ofcourse, I had to send him money for the dinner. It was pretty expensive. \n\nAnd now I have no money for the rest of the month. \n\nI have not been able to save up any money at all, eversince we started dating. If anything, I end up spending money from my savings. I have had to lie to my parents about my expenses to accomodate his. I can't even afford my own requirements now.\n\nIt is not his fault that he is poor. He always makes it clear that he has no money when I suggest going out. But... I like watching movies, eating out etc. I end up telling him that its going to be on me, because I want to go on a date so bad... and then I have to pay for both of us and I regret it later on. \n\nI also spend small amounts of money on him everyday for lunch and coffee and such... and it's just too much now.
