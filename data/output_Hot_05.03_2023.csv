,"Mentally destroyed after discovering that my mother escorted / made porn as recently as 3 years ago
Absolutely scarring experience, I found this while doing something for her on her phone by accidentally finding a mortifying photo of an ad she had made. Haven’t said anything to her as I wasn’t meant to find out. This is affecting me really really really fucking badly, and need some clarity on this so I can get my mental condition back to being able to focus on university, work, and sleep.",392,11ittji,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11ittji/mentally_destroyed_after_discovering_that_my/,622,"Remember that your mom is more than just your mom. She's a human being like anyone else, which means that she is a sexual being that desires and is desired. What she does with that is her right, her choice, and has nothing to do with you, or the role that she plays in your life.

That side of her life is not about you, so stop making it about you. It's not going to help you in any way to obsess over this.  

The less said about it the better."

,"Family went out last night without me.
First and foremost I’ve been battling anxiety and depression because of Covid. When Covid happened I had no one to lean on for help. My parents made fun of me for wearing a mask, my brother didn’t believe in it and my sister ignored me and my other brother hosted parties and got angry with me because I didn’t show but now makes fun of me and bullies me. 

I went to therapy Friday and found out that the root of my problem has been my family and work. My job keeps me at the lowest position and doesn’t promote me. I think they do it because I make under $20 a hour and others that apply want more. 

Last night I get a text from my sister because I was in the group message saying “thanks for the invite I had a blast” knowing that they all went out without me. I reached out to my mom asking her if she got invited out and she left me on read. This morning she plays dumb with me saying she was sleeping and wants to know if everything is alright. 

I have an expensive dinner to go to Saturday with my family. High end restaurant in my city. We go to this restaurant this time of year because of some people’s birthdays in my family. I’m thinking about not going since I was not included in last nights fun. I’m not sure what to do.",44,11ixbev,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11ixbev/family_went_out_last_night_without_me/,45,I feel like there is more to this story!
,"My dad thinks my girlfriend is ugly
A few months ago I met a lovely girl , we started dating and I showed a picture of her to my dad , little did I know that his reaction would hurt me so much , he looked at her picture for the first time and  felt repulsive ,  "" she looks like a maid servant "" is what uttered from his mouth . And I was shocked I wanted to shout at him in anger but kept my cool . Fast forward to today I'm still dating her and he's telling me that I should find somebody better looking , she is also 5 years elder to me and he thinks that she is taking advantage of me because I'm gullible and naive.  He believes that most of the decisions I've taken in life are dumb ..... my dad is a really great guy but I didn't know  he would react this way , he reasons with me saying ,  he wants what's right for me and I should look for someone with a better looking face, I feel so let down . He constantly reminds me about this every day to a point where I'm now questioning my own decision about dating her . I love her, but this thing keeps nagging me every day, and I'm not sure what to do. I'm scared to even introduce her to my dad . 
What would you do if you were in my shoes , and how would you guys handle it ?. Do you think it's bad dating someone 5 years older? I'm 24, and she's 29 .",50,11is1ld,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11is1ld/my_dad_thinks_my_girlfriend_is_ugly/,119,"I’m a 42 yr old dad. I have a 22 yr old son. I was bitching at him one day to do something with his life. He was going from dead end job to dead end job. He would come home and tell me or complain about his job. I didn’t want to hear it or listen to it. I just wanted him to find a job. He was trying to figure him self out. His response was “I can never make you happy”and I stopped and realized and thought about what he said to me that day. I still remember it clearly. He was right he can’t make me happy only I can make myself happy and only he can make himself happy. And only you can make your happy. You will never be able to make your dad happy and your not on this planet to make him happy. If he can’t do it on his own it’s because he has issues that he needs to work on, like myself. My son and I are now in a better place. He got a job at a gym and I enjoy talking to him now because he is not complaining no more. He is having fun with his life and that’s all I ever wanted for him. If your dad can’t understand that you have to do what you have to do to make your life count and make it the way you want to live it. It’s your life not his and we only get one shot at it. If you live that girl who gives a fuck as long as you and her are happy together. You are the one who is gonna share your life with her not your dad. You have to be able to please your self before you can please others. When you get that he will envy you because he won’t know how to get what you have. He won’t tell you but it’s true. Hopefully you do the right thing for yourself and your girl. Good luck"
,"9 year age gap
is 20yo and 29yo a weird age gap? (girl turned 20 in december, guy is turning 30 in april) is that strange? the guy knew her since she was 18 and pursued her when she was 19. is that weird? he’s not like.. creepy, he’s a pretty cool guy, everyone loves him, very sweet and kind. but what’s your opinion on the age gap..

edit: okay im going to provide a bit more context.

1. i’m the 20yo girl.. i promise lol. a bit more info on me, i’m not in college yet, decided not to go until i’m 10000% confident that i can mentally handle it.
(i suffer from severe adhd and bpd which impacts my daily life a LOT)
2. he does not have a pattern of chasing after younger girls, all the girls he’s pursued in the past have been around his age (no younger/older than 3 years)
3. he hasn’t settled into a salary job, we actually met at my work place when i was 18. when we started becoming friends around march 2022, he was quitting and now has moved onto a job in his career field. he does not live on his own yet, (we live in canada, the economy sucks). and he graduated college at 27.
4. he’s never really shown signs of manipulation, most of our decisions have been mutual on both sides, he’s never pushed me into making choices i didn’t feel comfortable with. i don’t feel like he has power over me or tries to control me. there’s been a couple instances during sex where he has tried to push his fetishes onto me, and i would have to be persistent in declining, but he would eventually stop.
so overall i’m not too sure, but then again, i don’t exactly trust my own stance because i am so much younger. hence why i came on here to ask you guys. there’s a lot that’s happened between us that would take me ages to type out. but this is the general basis of it.",362,11idvhv,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11idvhv/9_year_age_gap/,457,"I’m 29 and if I compare my level of emotional intelligence/general life experience to that of when I was 19, I’d say I’m almost an entirely different person.

,"Friend is mad at me for ""misgendering"" my boyfriend
I’m a cis woman (22) btw. 

So my boyfriend (20) recently came out as non binary and now goes by he/they pronouns. I was a little unsure about it at first because I thought it’s going to change our relationship but no, everything’s the same basically. We also have a friend who I call T because she’s basically the focal point of the story. 

T is a trans woman. I get along with her really good until yesterday. I don’t even know how it really came up but I talked with her and called my bf ""he"". She looked at me very pissed and told me to not misgender him, especially in her presence because it’s disrespectful. I told her that he goes by both he AND they pronouns. She basically dismissed it and said that it’s still disrespectful because by calling him ""him"" I’m being cis-normative and borderline transphobic. 

Eventually I brought my bf to us and asked him what he thinks because that’s basically what’s important. He said that it’s fine because (again) he goes by both he and they pronouns. T was basically just like ""whatever"" and was kinda rude to me the whole evening. Didn’t even say me goodbye, just walk straight past me. 

I talked with my bf about it again and apologised if I hurt him in any way but he said that it’s okay. He then showed me messages of him and T and T told him that he shouldn’t allow me misgendering him and that he can’t let people walk over him. 

I honestly feel really bad about all of this. Like my bf said it’s okay but I obviously don’t know if he’s being serious. And I kinda feel like a bigot even though I know I’m not transphobic.",277,11ie2kk,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11ie2kk/friend_is_mad_at_me_for_misgendering_my_boyfriend/,586,"Well, isn't T kinda invalidating your BF by not allowing him to be called ""he""? She is literally saying you can't use said pronoun when your BF said you can, how is that different from not allowing a trans woman to use ""she""? Only your BF can define what his pronouns are.

Sounds like T wanted to give you a lecture about pronouns but when she realized her mistake she just got mad at you because she doesn't want to be wrong."
,"MY GUY BEST FRIEND TOLD ME HE HAS FEELINGS
I have a guy best friend. He and I have been friends for over a year now, and thing have been great, we chat, we hangout occasionally, and we do all the best friend shenanigans you would think of. I have made it very clear that I don't want a relationship with anyone at the moment, I'd rather work on myself.

but lately, he's been ghosting me, and after three days of me spamming him with texts waiting for him to respond so I can make sure he's not in god's heavens or anything, he replied.

he replied saying that he had a great time with me and that he'll always remember me bla bla bla, but he wanted to not talk as we did before because he had feelings for me. I told him it was fine and that I won't be mad at him or anything and we \*ended it\* in a civil matter.

he wanted to not talk to me anymore because it hurts him and stuff. so I said it's ok. we were ok... but then I thought to myself... if he thinks that TALKING to me is going to make him get hurt... then how is he feeling seeing all my stories and posts on Instagram? so I removed him from my Instagram because I truly don't want to tease or seduce him.

but he went NUTS and removed me from all platforms and blocked me. HE EVEN TOOK IT TO THE NEXT LEVEL AND LEFT ALL THE GROUP CHATS THAT WE HAVE IN COMMON. a friend of mine also says that since I retweeted a quote of how some people don't deserve you and whatever around the time all that happened then he might have thought it was about him.

I really liked this guy, he has been a great friend and I stood by him so many times. I cry everyday thinking that I messed it up. when it was literally him that said he doesn't want to talk to me anymore. I don't know, I have never had any experience with guys before and this is truly new to me.. so please tell me.. how can I make it all right again? that's if I ever should.

PLUS, DOES ANYONE HERE HAVE SOME TYPE OF WAY I CAN GET OVER THIS FRIENDSHIP BREAKUP BECAUSE IT HURTS SOOO BADLY.

**UPDATE:** I couldn't hold it in any longer I texted him saying that I didn't mean him on the quote and whatever and he said he thought it was about him. he was a bit cold but I mean we DID say we weren't gonna be like before so yeah. I feel so much better now that I made things clearer.. thank you all for helping me here and I will move on from our friendship with peace now that I know I ended things the good way.",43,11iqfj6,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11iqfj6/my_guy_best_friend_told_me_he_has_feelings/,45,Girll!

,"My son (13) is a sociopath and tried to kill his sister (6). I want him out of our lives, what can I do?
This account was made as a throwaway three or four months ago, when I feared my son was trying to hurt my family. He proceeded to set the house on fire with his sister, my sister and two family dogs in it. He has been an escalating issue for several years (I will post my old draft below in comment) and at this point he went to stay with his dad while my family, now homeless, took emergency shelter at a hotel. Because of the arson, a social worker came to my daughter at school to check on her safety at home. General bases to cover like access to food and clothing, and if she was harmed in any way. They met with me after this, to let me know that my daughter has been sexually abused by my son. She is 6 and he is 13. I broke down hearing what the worker quoted to me and I still am. My poor daughter had never told me. From the time I guess this may have happened (from context of the social worker’s retelling; I don’t want to pressure her or ask questions), I can deduce she may have been as little as 3 or 4. She knows that I know and I told her she did the right thing. I’m doing my best to take care of her in this situation, asked the worker how to talk to her so she can feel safe, and filed the report and will file a restraining order.

The police are beginning to look to speak with my son. There is a reason this worries me. Ideally, they find him, and he gets arrested or sent to a facility. If he is given benefit, he will do or say anything to get what he wants. I don’t know what he’ll do or say but I know nothing is off limits. The worker mentioned they’d want to know if he was perpetuating abuse he was a victim of, so I have already prepared for the possibility that he accuses any family member, my boyfriend (my boyfriend has never been alone with either of them regardless of the fact that I trust him) or even myself of having abused him. I don’t suspect he has been abused but to him, no casualty is too great to spare in order to get what he wants. Everything is a means to an end. We have endured suicide threats (that we took seriously), physical violence, running away, vandalism and now arson/attempted murder because he didn’t get his way. 

I know I’m supposed to still love him. I don’t think I do. For the last year the house felt so tense when he was there. We were always on eggshells. Being away from him we feel like we finally have peace (with the exception of this news and him being involved in our lives again). All I want is to be done with him. I want to move forward with my daughter and never have him able to come near us or the possibility of him entering our lives. I know, big picture he needs to be away from people, guns and the internet and into serious therapy. Right now, I just want him out of our lives. How do I make sure this happens?",783,11hxh1t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11hxh1t/my_son_13_is_a_sociopath_and_tried_to_kill_his/,825,"It starts with inpatient crisis. He gets evaluated at an acute care facility, assessed for behaviors, diagnoses, level of care. From there, the acute care facility will recommend the best course of action then set it in motion. It’s possibly he may have to spend some time in DJJ given the arson, it such a but it’s a start. 

Getting a patient permanently institutionalized is a long process. It likely requires several rounds of acute and long term care before insurances will approve, there’s also usually a pretty long wait list too. Age may also be an issue. I don’t know of many places anymore that take children into that type of setting. 

I’m an adolescent inpatient counselor and have seen many children like yours. It’s so hard on everyone and the process is heartbreakingly slow. Rest assured that you’ve done nothing wrong, some people are just born broken and we can’t fix them. You have to do what is best for everyone, including your son. Best of luck to you. Stay strong, and take care of you and your family."
,"I'm probably gonna disappear completely sometime soon.
I'm 16 sophomore in high school. I honestly dont even know where to start but I've been diagnosed w more than 30 mental illnesses. even though some of them aren't technically official like schizophrenia bc of the fact that u cant actually get diagnosed w certain things till your 18 they just basically label it as onset schizoaffective disorder or whatever it is they just say its onset bc they basically know I have it but cant diagnose it officially. I have ADHD BPD schizophrenia insomnia depression extreme paranoia antisocial personality disorder which basically means I'm a diagnosed psychopath dissociative personality disorder stress anxiety conduct disorder social anxiety disorder and a lot of others. if I misspelled any its because I'm typing this while I'm rly fuckin high. I've been smoking since i was about 12 and drinking since a year before that. I've taken long breaks from smoking and drinking to see if it makes anything better but it never does even after months of not smoking or drinking. i have really bad trauma because growing up a lot of my friends ended up dying some of them right in front of me. one of their birthdays was today. I try to talk to people about it sometimes but most of the time they just dont listen or dont take it seriously. I was in a rly bad abusive relationship about 2 years ago but no one took it seriously because I'm a guy and no one believed me. all of this is just locked up in my head all day because no one knows about it. no one ever asks and if they did they wouldn't care. I have friends but they always lie to me. I know most of them r using me. I've gone to therapy counseling psychologists psychiatrists everything and nothing helps no matter what i say or do. I'm on 13 different medications right now most of which I'm taking double all the way up to 8x regular doses of. my parents dont rly care ab me and they never have. one time I disappeared for 3 weeks and they barely even noticed. didnt do anything no police report didnt even wonder where I was. they never rly talked to me or interacted w me at all as a child. I'm not rly sure if I grew up poor or if they just didnt give me anything because i slept on a bare mattress with no pillows sheets or blanket. i still have back problems from sitting on the floor all day on my computer since they didnt get me a chair or desk. i dont think I've ever been in love w anyone ever and I dont think ill ever b able to love someone. i dont think anyone will ever rly love me either. most of my family hates me most of my friends r fake. the only place I've ever felt real was on the internet but now this place is so dead theres no one to talk to ever. I try to tell people whats on my mind but no one ever responds. I honestly dont rly have any reason to stay in this town anymore. for months I've been thinking ab just disappearing one day and not coming back. I'm just so alone everyone I've ever cared ab is dead. all I want is someone who cares about me. I just want a fucking hug. I just want someone to love me because aft all the shit I've been thru I fuckin deserve it. I dont know wtf to do.

,"Introverted black single mom with no friends
I'm 27F and very lonely. I have a 9 month old son and my ex has gone no contact and disappeared. My only friends think I'm gross for having sex and a baby before marriage. I'm not even Christian anymore. The only people who want to talk to me are creepy dudes who want a one night stand or want to get with a vulnerable woman to harm me more. I like white guys, I need to point that out, but most of them are rude and give me unsolicited opinions about how they'd never date a black woman or how I should have used protection and they wouldn't raise a black man's baby when I didn't ask them to. I'm just looking for friends and get that BS the moment I they find out. My mom hates me and her solution is to find another man. I work overnights so my parents can babysit and my coworkers hate me too. The nicest ones don't even speak English.

I live in Mankato, Minnesota. Not many black people here, and the ones that are here are mostly from Somalia, a Muslim country, and most of them don't speak much English. I met some Somalian people a few years ago, but a lady I used to talk to a lot now says I should get back with my abusive ex because raising a baby without him goes against God, and I'm gross for not being married before sex. That's probably most of their culture's opinions. I'm so tired of religion being used against me and racist white people making me feel like dirt. I should move, but I don't know where I can go where I'd be welcome. I'm not trying to get with another man. I just want friends so I don't go insane. I don't know what I can do around here when I work overnights, sleep in the afternoons, and don't know people to go to bars with. (Don't want to drink either because I'm nursing.)

I think I'm on the autism spectrum and stumble over my words when I'm talking in person along with feeling like crap and always embarrassed like a spotlight is on me.
