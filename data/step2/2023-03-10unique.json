He was right he can\u2019t make me happy only I can make myself happy and only he can make himself happy. And only you can make your happy. You will never be able to make your dad happy and your not on this planet to make him happy. If he can\u2019t do it on his own it\u2019s because he has issues that he needs to work on, like myself.

I was a little unsure about it at first because I thought it\u2019s going to change our relationship but no, everything\u2019s the same basically. We also have a friend who I call T because she\u2019s basically the focal point of the story. \n\nT is a trans woman. I get along with her really good until yesterday. I don\u2019t even know how it really came up but I talked with her and called my bf \"he\". She looked at me very pissed and told me to not misgender him, especially in her presence because it\u2019s disrespectful. I told her that he goes by both he AND they pronouns. She basically dismissed it and said that it\u2019s still disrespectful because by calling him \"him\" I\u2019m being cis-normative and borderline transphobic. \n\nEventually I brought my bf to us and asked him what he thinks because that\u2019s basically what\u2019s important. He said that it\u2019s fine because (again) he goes by both he and they pronouns. T was basically just like \"whatever\" and was kinda rude to me the whole evening. Didn\u2019t even say me goodbye, just walk straight past me. \n\nI talked with my bf about it again and apologised if I hurt him in any way but he said that it\u2019s okay.

        "Question": "My son (13) is a sociopath and tried to kill his sister (6). I want him out of our lives, what can I do?\nThis account was made as a throwaway three or four months ago, when I feared my son was trying to hurt my family. He proceeded to set the house on fire with his sister, my sister and two family dogs in it. He has been an escalating issue for several years (I will post my old draft below in comment) and at this point he went to stay with his dad while my family, now homeless, took emergency shelter at a hotel. Because of the arson, a social worker came to my daughter at school to check on her safety at home. General bases to cover like access to food and clothing, and if she was harmed in any way. They met with me after this, to let me know that my daughter has been sexually abused by my son. She is 6 and he is 13. I broke down hearing what the worker quoted to me and I still am. My poor daughter had never told me. From the time I guess this may have happened (from context of the social worker\u2019s retelling; I don\u2019t want to pressure her or ask questions), I can deduce she may have been as little as 3 or 4. She knows that I know and I told her she did the right thing. I\u2019m doing my best to take care of her in this situation, asked the worker how to talk to her so she can feel safe, and filed the report and will file a restraining order.\n\nThe police are beginning to look to speak with my son. There is a reason this worries me. Ideally, they find him, and he gets arrested or sent to a facility. If he is given benefit, he will do or say anything to get what he wants. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do or say but I know nothing is off limits. The worker mentioned they\u2019d want to know if he was perpetuating abuse he was a victim of, so I have already prepared for the possibility that he accuses any family member, my boyfriend (my boyfriend has never been alone with either of them regardless of the fact that I trust him) or even myself of having abused him. I don\u2019t suspect he has been abused but to him, no casualty is too great to spare in order to get what he wants. Everything is a means to an end. We have endured suicide threats (that we took seriously), physical violence, running away, vandalism and now arson/attempted murder because he didn\u2019t get his way. \n\nI know I\u2019m supposed to still love him. I don\u2019t think I do. For the last year the house felt so tense when he was there. We were always on eggshells. Being away from him we feel like we finally have peace (with the exception of this news and him being involved in our lives again). All I want is to be done with him. I want to move forward with my daughter and never have him able to come near us or the possibility of him entering our lives. I know, big picture he needs to be away from people, guns and the internet and into serious therapy. Right now, I just want him out of our lives. How do I make sure this happens?",

I have also been getting out of a bad break up but he started touching me and pulling at my pants and one thing I did know. I did not want to have sex with this guy. I told him no and he started teasing that I'm hard. Which I was and I found that confusing because I 100% did not want to have sex with this guy. He kept pushing himself on me and picked me up putting on the sick. I told him NO! and I'm serious and started pushing at him but he just grabbed my hands and kept saying I do want it. I started crying at that point begging him not to rape me and that's when he stopped.  I was crying and he left me there. I pulled my pants back up and today recieved a text saying he's sorry if he scared me... But I feel odd that I had a boner when I did not want to have sex with him.

The management has been really awful and we have a high staff turnover. Up until recently we were not allowed any days off and if we were sick we were still expected to work as we could \u201cjust sit in the classroom and tell the children what to do\u201d. This kind of approach lead to 3 teachers leaving at once, resulting in me having to cover many new classes or even have 2 year levels in a class at once (which is difficult when they\u2019re on completely different curriculum/topics and need individual attention). \nA few weeks ago we hired more teachers so we could all have a lighter work load and be covered if someone was sick or needed a day off. The manager was the first one to take advantage of this and took a day off for a family birthday. So I also put in a request to have a day off as my partner is a professional athlete and will be playing in a very important final next week. I got the day approved and I worked out travel and accommodation for the match. That is until today, when she texted me to say that I can\u2019t have the day off anymore because she injured her foot  (a small cut with a couple of stitches) and is now on 2 weeks of sick leave, meaning I have to cover her classes. I didn\u2019t reply because I was extremely frustrated and didn\u2019t know how to respond so I went to the gym to blow off some steam. When I arrived at the gym I saw said manager working out on the treadmill and stair master. We didn\u2019t acknowledge each other. Now I don\u2019t know how to respond.

Their bullying can be calculating and truly heartbreakingly nasty. \n\nExclusion is also a really tough finger to point at\u2026 they\u2019re all free to choose their friend group so it\u2019s a very easy form of bullying that can be sort of \u2018excused\u2019 with a little gaslighting. \n\nI would be very careful with the friend group, encourage her to cast her net further afield while still remaining \u2018friendly\u2019 with this lot.  \n\nMy daughter has had this exact scenario happen then was slowly but surely more and more excluded until she was outright ostracized and ignored\u2026 we\u2019re looking to change schools as she\u2019s self harming (14y/o). \n\nHopefully I\u2019m wrong and all the other posters are correct but none the less, be open and available, ALWAYS have her back and encourage her to integrate new friends into her life.",

He's an all around asshole, and I just hate him. About a year ago he was fishing on a boat, and it sank, 1 person who was onboard died, and ever since he's been a little more fucked than usual. He's done nothing but drink and get mad and yell ever since. Sure he did all of that stuff before on a weekly basis, but ever since it's been on about a daily basis. So for about a year he just didn't work whatsoever because he's been scared to go back on a boat, but since we're broke as shit he finally went back on the water for a week last week. Apparently they tormented him on the boat and kept playing tricks about the boat going down to fuck with him, so he came home and went on a 3 day bender, yelling and breaking shit for 3 days straight. My mom also happens to be pretty sick, and she's having lots of lung related problems,and she has to go in tomorrow overnight. And he wants me to stay tomorrow to keep him company. Now the thing is, I know if I stay, I'm probably not going to leave my room once so I don't see what difference it makes. On top of that I've already missed a lot of school recently, and while he was on his bender I didn't leave my room for 3 days, so I haven't eaten in 3 days, because I obviously didn't want to go out and deal with him screaming and breaking shit, so for that reason alone I think he deserves to be alone for a day. But the good guy inside of me wants to stay, what should I do?",

        "Question": "My (50F) son (15M) has become a far-right extremist and I have no idea what to do\n \n\nThrowaway account because this is too embarrassing.\n\nFor some context, my son is on the spectrum and has difficulty forming relationships with people as a result, although he still has a few in person friends. He's extremely intelligent, and knows many things, especially when he puts his mind to it. I also know he uses a lot of social media, since it's easier for him to make friends that way, however I did not monitor them which I regret doing.\n\nThe first red flag was when he was 13 and he began talking to me about various statistics which he said proved that the races were not equal, like crime and IQ, and when I pointed out there are societal reasons for this, he went on a rant and said that that these are actually biological (I still don't know what his sources are). At that time I just chalked it up to him not understanding the world very well and assumed he would grow out of it, but it has only gotten worse in every way.\n\nHe ordered a copy of Mein Kampf to our home. Fortunately, I saw the package and threw it away before he could get his hands on it, but when I confronted him about it, he started screaming and telling me that all his online friends and he started a reading group where they would read books together and they started with Mein Kampf, and that now he would be left out. I asked him if any of his friends at school were reading Mein Kampf, and he said that they were \"normies\" who didn't understand reality. I asked him if he thought I was a \"normie\" too, and he went on an incredibly misogynistic tirade against me saying that I was a \"whore\" and a \"roastie\" (I looked up what it meant later and I was horrified) for pursuing my career (which has provided our family with lots of money, including that he benefits from!) and for openly talking about my past relationships before I met his father, and also because his father and were never married and now separated. He told me he hated me for ruining his life by waiting \"so long\" to have children which is why he was on the spectrum and had difficulty talking to people (many of my friends had children at my age and they did not have children on the spectrum, not that it's a problem anyway). And that was only the beginning, I do not wish to go into more detail, but I couldn't even say anything to him as I broke down crying. I loved my son and we were so close until that point and never before had anything so mean ever been said to me. I couldn't handle it. I didn't understand why he would say such horrible things to me, or how he could have learned such ideas. I am a progressive, and especially feminist, and I thought I was raising our son to hold the same values, but he became the complete opposite of what I wanted him to be.\n\nIn the aftermath of this, I confiscated his computer and phone, although I did let him send one last message to his horrible \"friends\" since he wouldn't stop screaming to us about how he couldn't just abandon them without saying anything. However, this did not help in any way. He began spending more and more time outside the house, which I thought was a good thing and that maybe he was socializing with his peers who didn't accept this sort of thing. I also noticed over the next few months that he was getting more and more muscular, I was proud of him, but I also did not want him to believe he had to prove his \"manliness\" by getting big muscles, he then cursed me out and told me I was trying to make him a \"soyboy\" (a term I did not know and had to look up) so he didn't care what I had to say. Eventually I find out he somehow managed to find a skinhead gang after school and they workout together... after I saw him with them, I screamed at him and then at them that they as grown men should stop trying to manipulate a teenage boy and there was no reason for him to spend time with strange men in their 20s and 30s.\n\nAfter that, I was very strict about everything he was doing. I would pick him up and drop him off, even though it meant I needed to take off time from work to do so. When I dropped him off at home, I locked the doors to make sure he could not escape before returning to work. However, this did not work either, and eventually I was called by the school principle who let us know that he and his school friends (who he has also convinced to become Nazis now!) had beaten a group of POC boys up and that he and his friends would receive a suspension as a result. I was so livid. I could not imagine the fact I was raising a future criminal, and he told me that I was a traitor for not being proud of him for being stronger than them and for beating up \"murderers of our people, rapists of our women, and invaders of our lands\". No reason can get to him, and no discipline can get to him. And now I AM SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES TOO, all my friends now assume I must be a racist because of my son, and don't want to spend time with me anymore. The other parents at the school avoid me. People who used to be friendly are now cold. I have no idea how to deal with this situation, can anyone here on Reddit give me good advice?",

I have not been a victim of sexual abuse.  I am not transgender.  I feel like a woman, and would be unhappy with a penis.  (Any ideas what could be up with me here?)  Physically and mentally, I am a woman; however recently I have come to wonder if it is possible to be psychologically one gender but *socially* the other, if that makes sense.  The way a man treats a male friend is very different than a woman treats a woman, a woman treats a man, or a man treats a woman.  There is a specific kind of friendship and interaction I have only ever observed between men, and it saddens me that it is unlikely I will ever fully experience that type of bond.\n\nBesides this lack of sex drive and such, I am not much of a people person.  I have my one good friend, and that was all I needed, but I\u2019m losing him through no intention of either of us.  I have made a few work friends, even having gone to parties with some and out to a restaurant for drinks with another, but find it hard to be with people.\n\n---\n\nWe were originally \u201cpen-pals\u201d (keyboard pals).  I was in university and heavily struggling.  It turns out I had some wild anemia that should have left me completely incapable (but somehow didn\u2019t quite) and some fucky hormones that were making it hard to function, but I didn\u2019t get those answers when I needed them.  I felt very overwhelmed and alone, ended up on a penpal-finding site, and he messaged me.  At first, I was annoyed by his comment that he, too, knew how it felt, to feel like one was getting left behind in a world that was moving on too fast, but kept that thought to myself and kept the conversation going.  Turns out, he really did know, better than I.\n\nWe became great friends.  We could tell each other anything.  I learned he was ill, lost most his friends because of it (when he couldn\u2019t party, the partiers left; when he couldn\u2019t work, those relationships dissolved; when he couldn\u2019t play cricket, his teammates were no longer teammates).  He left home at 17 to escape an abusive alcoholic father, worked so hard on his education, got his degree, and I imagine life was finally becoming okay.  He only got to work a few years at the career he fought for before he became ill, and eventually couldn\u2019t physically perform regardless of how hard he pushed.  He and I found each other and became pen-pals a few years later, at which point he was mobile within his home and usually managed to get outside a little bit once every few days.\n\nHe was (is?) fun and upbeat, charismatic, witty.  I was surprised to eventually learn that he had gone through some sexual and emotional abuse/trauma that left him with body dysmorphia, feeling worthless and unlovable, on-and-off suicidal with several botched attempts.  Even before this came out, we were very close, and it made me more comfortable with being open about my own struggles with the idea of sex.  Our problems here were very different, but somehow also very much the same.\n\nYears of phone calls and photos and daily text-chats went by.  He\u2019d often express his regret that I wasn\u2019t from somewhere closer (\u201cshame you\u2019re not local\u201d); we\u2019d talk about how nice it would be if I could just pop in for a cup of tea and a visit, sometimes.  We\u2019d discussed the possibility of me coming to meet him, someday.  Perhaps that amount of long-distance communication is odd and unhealthy.  What do you think?  Can someone really be friends with a person they\u2019ve never met?  Were we too co-dependent?  \n\nAnyway\u2026 a couple years went by, and I ended up going traveling through a few countries that were close together.  At the last country, I ended up on his doorstep.  He didn\u2019t know I was coming, and I had found a few accommodations (hostels and campgrounds) nearby that I\u2019d intended to check out and check into one of once I arrived.  I thought he\u2019d probably chat with me on his doorstep, and if things went well I would come back and spend more time with him other days.  To my surprise, this beautiful, generous, vulnerable human who had no idea I was coming *trusted* me, opened up his little home to me, and made it clear that I was welcome to anything in it.  Though he is just renting one room in the house, I ended up there at a point where 3 others had just left and a fourth was in the process of moving out and no longer lived there, so we had privacy and the run of the house.\n\nWe watched movies together and played a board game he ordered.  We sat around and drank tea and listened to music and chatted and were our odd selves.  I had recently joined a cricket team in my home country, and he helped me practice his sport a bit outside.  He wanted to make sure I explored and did some touristy things, and would find me maps and send me off on adventures he couldn\u2019t follow on.  As I walked out the door, he\u2019d be grabbing me my the backpack to stuff in snacks and juice and the like.  He told me what foods I should try and where to get them, and once when I got home from a hike, I found he had made me a big pot of pasta.  I know that took a good bit of effort with his limited energy.  I felt so cared about.  I loved so well, and was so well-loved.  But, of course, I had to go back to my own country.  Those were a happy 10 days that I\u2019ve been chasing ever since.\n\nWe continued chatting via text and phone call, sharing photos and videos.  A few months later, we planned for me to return the next summer.  We thought I might get a YM Visa down the road, so I could live and work out there for a couple years, but I\u2019m getting older and trying to start a career, and am only eligible for that visa until I am 30, and I can\u2019t see this being a possibility in the next few years, so I guess that\u2019s that, then.  Yet another thing the pandemic ripped from me.\n\n After I left that first time, I kept becoming even fonder of him.  I loved him; I knew that for a long time.  He felt like a cool older brother, sort of, and I loved him that way.  But also I was discovering it was a versatile kind of love.  I *could* love him like a sibling.  I could love him as if he were my son, and I were ferociously maternally protective.  I could love him as a friend.  I felt a sort of attraction I\u2019d never felt, before, too.  I could love him romantically, if I so chose.  So I did, and once I spilled my guts out to him, he eventually came around to the idea as well.  I didn\u2019t push him; he just grew into the idea on his own.  We we became even closer, in this strange new way.  Eventually, I felt willing \u2013\u2013 excited, even \u2013\u2013 to try to explore some physical intimacy and sexuality with him.\n\nThe pandemic started getting attention a couple weeks before my flight would have left, and he urged me to cancel my ticket and try again when it was sorted out and safer in a few weeks.  Boy, if we knew then what we know now\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been 4 years since I\u2019ve seen him.  He\u2019s gotten gradually sicker the whole time, which was somewhat expected.  Most days he\u2019s not really well enough to chat back-and-forth, but will still text me to let me know he\u2019s okay.  On lucid/focused/better (never \u201cgood\u201d) days we chat and I see his old self peek out from time to time.  He is vaccinated, but caught COVID a while back, which also did not help things. I thought that post-covid would be a good time to slip in a visit, during the window which he had the antibodies from fighting off the infection and would be protected by both the vaccine and natural immunity.  He said he was too sick to visit (I think he\u2019s self-conscious about his situation; things must be unravelling over there) and too scared, and I watched that little window where I could visit without putting him in danger slowly close.\n\nI know I won\u2019t see him again, now.  I\u2019ve tried to come to terms with that for the last few years, but keep finding myself picking up scraps of hope.  I wish I could move on.  I\u2019ve tried.  I have a hard time finding people I can make connections with, and he was one of the precious few.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever experience a romantic connection again.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever feel ready to explore intimacy again.  I don\u2019t want to die a virgin, but I can\u2019t bring myself to even consider touching anyone else, yet.  Maybe the right person will come along, and be patient enough to stand by me for years as a friend, until I feel safe and secure and emotionally connected/intimate enough to try.\n\nI just can\u2019t stop thinking of all those little pockets of happiness we\u2019ve had, and all the happiness I never got the chance to have.  I imagined getting home from work and crawling into bed behind him, or making dinner while he kept me company.  I thought about the movies and music I wanted to share with him, all the cups of tea I wanted to drink with him.  I think about wanting to wake up to that bright face and its absurdly mobile eyebrows (he emotes with these in the most adorable, exaggerated way, lol), that beautifully rough voice and its prickly accent.  I never met his mum, but we sort-of interacted, and we somewhat communicated through him.  Early on, when we were just starting to get close as keyboard-pals, I guess he told his mum and sister about me.  They asked about me a few times over the year, and supposedly expressed fondness.  I\u2019ve asked about them some, too, and get the impression that I would get along with his little family very well.  As creepy as I\u2019m sure this is, I looked forward to meeting them, and am sad I will not.  I always thought I\u2019d bring his Mum a little pot of zinnias to first meet her, and we\u2019d probably end up drinking tea and talking about bits and bobs and\u2026\n\nanyway, I\u2019m rambling.  It\u2019s just a weird thing.  I always knew this relationship was a long shot and could never actually last, but I wanted to steal a few more happy moments in this life, and thought I could help supply some better moments to him, too, and it\u2019s hard watching that opportunity become an impossibility and not knowing whether I will ever feel such a connection again, or if I even want to feel such a connection with someone else.  I know this whole thing has been absolutely absurd from the beginning, but kind of wonderful, too.\n\n---\n\nWas this relationship always unhealthy?  Was it weird?  How do I get over it?  How do I move on?\n\nAny idea what's up with my sexuality?  What can I do about that?  I don't want my broken sexuality.  I want to be able to explore.\n\nWhat about my thought of being \"socially male\"?  Any idea what that might be?  Is there a term for it?",

In most circumstances/ with most people ( or Layla solo) I wouldn\u2019t mind but I really do not want to spend any amount of nights with her kids.. I love them. I truly do. I just can\u2019t handle how naughty they are.. The younger one isn\u2019t that bad but the older child, Keith (8),who I suspect is neurodivergent, does not listen, he is very rude, has little to no manners, and is mischievous in scary ways. Part of me wants to support her because she\u2019s a single mom but the other part of me doesn\u2019t want to ruin this time away from me, my husband or kids.. Because of the last trip we took together where Keith was caught stealing, set a garbage can on fire, and wouldn\u2019t listen to Layla at all; My husband was a firm no. so, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do but I don\u2019t know how to tell my sister without this coming off really bad..

I go to the bar TO TALK to other people that don't work with me or live in my house.   There are dozens of people I talk to at our local bar.  There are several friendship groups that occasionally invite me to stuff because I know them through the bar.\n\nThis is difficult for introverted people.  Not only do you have to put yourself out there, some people won't always like you or want to talk to you.   That's life.   Its also difficult if nobody is up there.  If no one is there, I have just one or two and chat with the bartender (all of whom I know.)   This is more difficult in packed clubs with a hundred people.\n\nEvery serious relationship I've ever had happened when I wasn't \"trying\" to meet someone.  Its almost like trying too hard messes everything up.   Just be yourself and be open to making friends and talking to other people.  The rest will happen eventually",

        "Question": "Should I break off the wedding? Fianc\u00e9 hates my dad to the point of hurting me\nEdit: explaining what fianc\u00e9 did to provoke dads behavior-he was having a bad day at work and yelled and was cussing not really at me-but in general. He also threw a drawer straight down on the floor because of how worked up he was. Once again none of it was at me or directed towards me in any way. But my dad felt like you shouldn\u2019t talk to my daughter in that way-\u201cshe\u2019s a lady.\u201d When he confronted my fianc\u00e9 my fianc\u00e9 said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have acted that way BUT-I was mad. My dad blew up because he felt since my fianc\u00e9 had to throw a BUT in there-he wasn\u2019t actually that sorry.\n\n\nI was raised by a single dad. My dad has a lot of faults-one of him is the way he talks to people is disrespectful and he has a temper. He never physically hurts anyone but he\u2019s not afraid of cussing someone out. I know he has wrongs but I also see the damaged side of him and what he went through after mom left. So I still love him for all the years he was hurt and raised me. \n\nAbout 2 months ago my dad got in a huge fight with my fianc\u00e9. My fianc\u00e9 was initially in the wrong. Dad got to the point where he went to my fianc\u00e9s work and cussed him out in front of his boss. And then went and told my fianc\u00e9s parents all his issues he has with me marrying my fianc\u00e9. \n\nI called my dad and yelled at him and told him he went way to far and didn\u2019t talk to him hardly for like 2 or 3 weeks. But I still love dad. As wrong as he may be. My fianc\u00e9 has not dropped it since. He brings it up about once a week how much of a jerk my dad is and how much he hates him. After I told him he needed to let it go because it was causing us to fight he stopped talking about it as much. But still brings it up occasionally. I try to let him get his temper out but then he will say something like I never want your dad at the house again. If you want to see him it can\u2019t be on my property. And I think to myself he hates my dad so much that he\u2019s willing to hurt my relationship with my dad because of what he did? Like I feel at that point he\u2019s ok with hurting me. \n\nI try to explain to my fianc\u00e9 that I know my dad did a bad thing but I feel he doesn\u2019t care about my feelings when he\u2019s making me take half the punishment by saying I don\u2019t want your dad to ever come over and see our new house. But he sees it as me defending my dads behavior. I\u2019ve tried to make him see my perspective for months. And I\u2019m also trying to register how much my dad embarrassed him and of how my fianc\u00e9 is acting is justified in any way\u2026..\n\nShould I break this or not?",

We have been together for almost 6 years, as the title states he is a dealer. I have been trying to encourage him to get a job for years, and he acts like a complete man child about it, he has a temper problem when it comes to any kind of authority over him. Other than that we really don\u2019t get into disagreements so it makes this harder for me. When we started dating we only did it because it was what we had to do if we wanted food or shelter, but now he\u2019s became lazy. He just wants fast easy ways to get rich (y\u2019all don\u2019t even know how many crypto scams I have prevented him from giving our savings to) and not put in effort for anything he wants in life. Obviously I can\u2019t just change him and make him work, but idk what to do anymore and I\u2019m tired of it. To make things worse I\u2019m a very introverted person and don\u2019t have any near friends I could just move in with if I decided to leave. I hate saying I\u2019m with him only for financial reasons because I do really love him, but ultimately if I had the money I would have been gone long ago. He just keeps saying he\u2019s going to get a job as an \u201centrepreneur\u201d but as I said he wants everything handed to him with no effort.  Anyways what can or should I do?",

A budgie/parakeet and a canary. They both live in separate cages. Their cages are kept in a back sunroom. It seems I forgot to lock the outside access door when I went out (have had lots on my mind recently). When home I found they had been stabbed, cut up, inside their cages, blood and feathers. No valuables are kept in this room and I'm unsure if anything is missing. This is quite disturbing.\n\nThey are only small birds but were pets.

        "Question": "I just want my name change to be respected.\nI\u2019m going to try to make all of this simple to you guys since it\u2019s rocket-science to my family that I wanted a feminine name and gave it to myself. I just wanted to feel satisfied. \n\nI was born with a name that I did not like, so I changed it last year when I was 19. I\u2019m 20 now and my family still can\u2019t get with the program. I changed my name because I always hated it. My mom named me something so masculine. Before you guys get on me, I\u2019m aware that gender neutral names exist but this wasn\u2019t that. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cJordan\u201d or \u201cAlex\u201d situation. She named me after a famous male actor because she thought he was sexy and she\u2019d never heard of a girl with his name before. She said I was going to be named that no matter if I was a boy or girl. Then, to make shit even worse, she gave me a feminine middle name. I\u2019d been getting comments and questions about my name since I was in elementary school and I was seven years old telling myself that I\u2019d change my name because I was just so tired. I just wanted to not be embarrassed. \n\nThe last straw that lead me to change my name was when I was at work and a guy asked me my name. I told him and he raised a brow and asked \u201cLike the actor?\u201d and I told him yes. Then, he proceeded to say \u201cWell, you\u2019re still beautiful anyway\u201d and left. That was when I started the process of legally filing to change my name. \n\nWhen the name change did finalize and happen, my mom just couldn\u2019t understand my choice. She compared it to how transgender people change their gender (I couldn\u2019t get a grip on her comparison) and she compared my name to her name, saying she\u2019d been teased all her life but her name is very much just feminine and Biblical. People know she\u2019s a woman before they see her face but I had people thinking I was a guy before they ever even saw me because my name was so masculine.  She said I should\u2019ve took that as a good thing and used every excuse in the book to avoid understanding my perspective. She even said it was disrespectful. Disrespectful for me to want a girly name so that I can live within my girly self? Disrespectful for me to not want to feel bad when people made unnecessary comments and said that my birth name was a \u201cboy name\u201d? \n\nRegardless of me changing my name, my family still continues to call me by my old name. I\u2019ve tried to reenforce it but they just won\u2019t listen. However, they always expect me to respect them but deliberately choose to ignore my wishes. Only a FEW people in my family try to respect my name change and best believe I can only count on one hand. I\u2019ve received better support from friends. My dad told me on the phone that he would still call me by my birth name but he still mixes it up and calls me by both names. My big sister says she\u2019s not calling me by my new name because she\u2019s not used to it and I don\u2019t look like the name that I\u2019ve picked. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019ve done this for no reason. \n\nI\u2019m going to the military sometime this year and I\u2019ve made it a goal to get this respect thing situated. I\u2019m old enough to receive the same respect the adults in my family expect from me so if they\u2019re still doing this to me when I join, I\u2019m cutting them off. I even told myself that they\u2019d be banned from my wedding if I get married and even the birth of my children if I have any if they can\u2019t respect my choice. My wedding invites and baby shower invites would say my new name and I don\u2019t need any confusion or embarrassment when my family meets my future husband\u2019s family. The way my family is acting, they\u2019re going to miss out on all that stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s not THAT hard to call someone what they want to be called and I don\u2019t know what I can do to change them from being ignorant.\n\nEDIT: Why would my mom throw trans people in the mix when if I did want to be trans, I\u2019d have to take one less step considering the fact that my name literally used to be masculine? She set me up with a masculine name anyway so I wouldn\u2019t have had to change my name if I wanted to be a male. It makes no sense. Give a girl a masculine name and then get mad at her for wanting a feminine name instead? Am I wrong?",

People want to be around fun people. If you can make it fun it'll become... Fun (I feel like I've said fun to often).\n\nIf not, that's okay, jobs suck.\n\nAre you maybe missing some hobbies or other activities? Make yourself more then your job.\n\nThanks for posting this, it was interesting to think about and try to help.",

        "Question": "My partner split up with me, 6 months later texting me about dental bills\nWhen I lived with my partner I paid for a discounted dental plan for both of us through my employer's scheme. He insisted it wasn't working between us and I needed to move out. I texted him a month later to say I needed to take him from my insurance. He asked if he could pay to keep me on it. I said I'd look into it, I did and it was pretty clear that it was a plan for me and my partner so I notified HR who changed all of my policies to be me only. I didn't tell him as I was trying to move on and not have too much contact.\n\nA few months later he asked if he was still on my insurance. I said he wasn't and he texted me back saying I didn't tell him and now he has dental bills. I did tell him but I also told him I'd look into keeping him on and didn't update him.\n\nSome time later he texted me about how his energy bills are going to bankrupt him.\n\nToday he asked me again if he was definitely not on my insurance. Of course I said no and then he told me he'd got a \u00a33k bill to pay. I told him when we broke up he was no longer eligible for cover. He texted back \"oh dear\", then suggested I could move in until he's paid for dental work. \n\nI just feel incredibly guilty about it. If he was still with me the insurance would cover some of the expenses. Just the idea of him struggling with everything is eating away at me. I almost want to just send him a cheque to cover his bills.",

        "Question": "How can i explain to my gf that adding a bathroom to a new home isnt a priority?\nMe and my gf are in the final stages of purchasing a new home and we have all kinds of ideas to improve and customize an already renovated  home to our liking.  It\u2019s a single family 2 bathroom 4-1/2 bedroom house. In the top floor where we are going to have our master bedroom does not have a bathroom. My gf always wanted a third bathroom to be added which isnt a problem to me, because the two bathrooms are in the middle and basement floor respectively. \n\nUpon getting the house inspection done, it has been revealed that the water heater, and hvac system is 3-4 years past its  life expectancy and i would like to have that replaced before all other improvements are made. To me, it takes more of a priority over a bathroom because #1, a third bathroom isnt absolutely needed, Its more of a want imo and #2, the other two bathrooms have been renovated and look very good aesthetically. \n\nMy gf doesnt look at the hvac situation as seriously as i do and is dead set on this bathroom. She doesnt seem to be budging on this. What do you guys think? Btw, i would do both repairs/additions at the same time, but money plays a factor. The price to add a bathroom could be the same or more as the hvac system. We haven\u2019t moved in or gotten proper estimates yet.",

        "Question": "I (M20) am being bullied at college and I don't know what to do\n this is going to be long sorry, but I need to get it out, I have been depressed for a while and I can't get any work done, and I am typing this on my phone in a rush so sorry in advance.\n\ngenerally I don't believe reddit because I was being bullied at school and made a post about it and you guys told me college will be different and it will be the best days of my life, its not, but I don't have someone to talk to about this so I will post here, I am in my second year of CS, I'm the nerdy type of person, I'm also probably on the spectrum, and I can't talk properly, I keep suturing and I can't explain my thoughts properly, but I am doing great academically, actually I was doing great.\n\nI was bullied really bad in high school, I'm quite skinny and I don't look threatening or strong, and I am around 6ft which makes me look quite lanky, anyways, people would just take my stuff and humiliate me in general and if I tried to stand up for my self I would be beaten or they'd break my stuff, I had to lie to my parents about why my glasses were being broken, and eventually I just stopped using them and tried to attend school without glasses, I became quite depressed and my grades suffered, it never stopped until I ended up fighting someone of the bullied, another 6ft guy but much more mascular than me, I gave him a black eye and suddenly teachers cared enough and sent me to the principal, anyway, the bullying stopped because they knew I could actually hurt them.\n\nnow at college, there is this guy, a general asshole, very sociable and popular, there was a project and it required teams, I couldn't find a team because I am socially retarded, but we ended up in the same team, he didn't do any work at all, and was being demeaning to me, things like \"I don't really care what you think we should do\" or \"idgaf about your opinion\" for simply talking about what I think would be the best idea for the project, I got angry and told him to shut the fuck up and that he wasn't even doing anything, other group members got mad at me because \"he's just joking\", and they started making me the butt of every joke, project was done, I did most of the work, got an A+.\n\nbut the popular guy just keeps making fun of me behind my back, and people generally started avoiding me more, when we worked together he was gossiping a lot about people, \"this guy is gay\", \"this girl is a hoe because blah and blah\", mostly comments making fun of other guys and comments about other girls, mostly untrue tbh, and he keeps doing the same thing about me now with other people and now I look like a joke because he's spreading things about me that is untrue I know that for sure.\n\nnow I can't go to someone with this, they won't care lol, we're supposed to be adults I doubt any normal older adult will care, and if I beat him up I will be arrested because its not just a random underage school fight, at this point it will be considered assault, and I cant verbally stand up for my self, he is much more sociable and well spoken, and I can't form a sentence without stuttering, its just a world built for neurotypicals and I am considering killing my self tbh, or at least saving someone, quitting school and doing hard drugs until I overdose and die, it will only get worse from here, I will encounter people like this in my future career, relationships etc, and I am disadvantaged because I don't know how to talk, my gpa went down really bad, I got a D in two of subjects due to the social and humiliation rejection I encountered, I am pretty sure I am getting PTSD from school days, and I can't think about anything other than hurting this person, even if it will get me expelled or arrested.",
