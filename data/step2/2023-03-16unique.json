He was right he can\u2019t make me happy only I can make myself happy and only he can make himself happy. And only you can make your happy. You will never be able to make your dad happy and your not on this planet to make him happy. If he can\u2019t do it on his own it\u2019s because he has issues that he needs to work on, like myself.

I was a little unsure about it at first because I thought it\u2019s going to change our relationship but no, everything\u2019s the same basically. We also have a friend who I call T because she\u2019s basically the focal point of the story. \n\nT is a trans woman. I get along with her really good until yesterday. I don\u2019t even know how it really came up but I talked with her and called my bf \"he\". She looked at me very pissed and told me to not misgender him, especially in her presence because it\u2019s disrespectful. I told her that he goes by both he AND they pronouns. She basically dismissed it and said that it\u2019s still disrespectful because by calling him \"him\" I\u2019m being cis-normative and borderline transphobic. \n\nEventually I brought my bf to us and asked him what he thinks because that\u2019s basically what\u2019s important. He said that it\u2019s fine because (again) he goes by both he and they pronouns. T was basically just like \"whatever\" and was kinda rude to me the whole evening. Didn\u2019t even say me goodbye, just walk straight past me. \n\nI talked with my bf about it again and apologised if I hurt him in any way but he said that it\u2019s okay.

        "Question": "My son (13) is a sociopath and tried to kill his sister (6). I want him out of our lives, what can I do?\nThis account was made as a throwaway three or four months ago, when I feared my son was trying to hurt my family. He proceeded to set the house on fire with his sister, my sister and two family dogs in it. He has been an escalating issue for several years (I will post my old draft below in comment) and at this point he went to stay with his dad while my family, now homeless, took emergency shelter at a hotel. Because of the arson, a social worker came to my daughter at school to check on her safety at home. General bases to cover like access to food and clothing, and if she was harmed in any way. They met with me after this, to let me know that my daughter has been sexually abused by my son. She is 6 and he is 13. I broke down hearing what the worker quoted to me and I still am. My poor daughter had never told me. From the time I guess this may have happened (from context of the social worker\u2019s retelling; I don\u2019t want to pressure her or ask questions), I can deduce she may have been as little as 3 or 4. She knows that I know and I told her she did the right thing. I\u2019m doing my best to take care of her in this situation, asked the worker how to talk to her so she can feel safe, and filed the report and will file a restraining order.\n\nThe police are beginning to look to speak with my son. There is a reason this worries me. Ideally, they find him, and he gets arrested or sent to a facility. If he is given benefit, he will do or say anything to get what he wants. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do or say but I know nothing is off limits. The worker mentioned they\u2019d want to know if he was perpetuating abuse he was a victim of, so I have already prepared for the possibility that he accuses any family member, my boyfriend (my boyfriend has never been alone with either of them regardless of the fact that I trust him) or even myself of having abused him. I don\u2019t suspect he has been abused but to him, no casualty is too great to spare in order to get what he wants. Everything is a means to an end. We have endured suicide threats (that we took seriously), physical violence, running away, vandalism and now arson/attempted murder because he didn\u2019t get his way. \n\nI know I\u2019m supposed to still love him. I don\u2019t think I do. For the last year the house felt so tense when he was there. We were always on eggshells. Being away from him we feel like we finally have peace (with the exception of this news and him being involved in our lives again). All I want is to be done with him. I want to move forward with my daughter and never have him able to come near us or the possibility of him entering our lives. I know, big picture he needs to be away from people, guns and the internet and into serious therapy. Right now, I just want him out of our lives. How do I make sure this happens?",

I have also been getting out of a bad break up but he started touching me and pulling at my pants and one thing I did know. I did not want to have sex with this guy. I told him no and he started teasing that I'm hard. Which I was and I found that confusing because I 100% did not want to have sex with this guy. He kept pushing himself on me and picked me up putting on the sick. I told him NO! and I'm serious and started pushing at him but he just grabbed my hands and kept saying I do want it. I started crying at that point begging him not to rape me and that's when he stopped.  I was crying and he left me there. I pulled my pants back up and today recieved a text saying he's sorry if he scared me... But I feel odd that I had a boner when I did not want to have sex with him.

The management has been really awful and we have a high staff turnover. Up until recently we were not allowed any days off and if we were sick we were still expected to work as we could \u201cjust sit in the classroom and tell the children what to do\u201d. This kind of approach lead to 3 teachers leaving at once, resulting in me having to cover many new classes or even have 2 year levels in a class at once (which is difficult when they\u2019re on completely different curriculum/topics and need individual attention). \nA few weeks ago we hired more teachers so we could all have a lighter work load and be covered if someone was sick or needed a day off. The manager was the first one to take advantage of this and took a day off for a family birthday. So I also put in a request to have a day off as my partner is a professional athlete and will be playing in a very important final next week. I got the day approved and I worked out travel and accommodation for the match. That is until today, when she texted me to say that I can\u2019t have the day off anymore because she injured her foot  (a small cut with a couple of stitches) and is now on 2 weeks of sick leave, meaning I have to cover her classes. I didn\u2019t reply because I was extremely frustrated and didn\u2019t know how to respond so I went to the gym to blow off some steam. When I arrived at the gym I saw said manager working out on the treadmill and stair master. We didn\u2019t acknowledge each other. Now I don\u2019t know how to respond.

Their bullying can be calculating and truly heartbreakingly nasty. \n\nExclusion is also a really tough finger to point at\u2026 they\u2019re all free to choose their friend group so it\u2019s a very easy form of bullying that can be sort of \u2018excused\u2019 with a little gaslighting. \n\nI would be very careful with the friend group, encourage her to cast her net further afield while still remaining \u2018friendly\u2019 with this lot.  \n\nMy daughter has had this exact scenario happen then was slowly but surely more and more excluded until she was outright ostracized and ignored\u2026 we\u2019re looking to change schools as she\u2019s self harming (14y/o). \n\nHopefully I\u2019m wrong and all the other posters are correct but none the less, be open and available, ALWAYS have her back and encourage her to integrate new friends into her life.",

He's an all around asshole, and I just hate him. About a year ago he was fishing on a boat, and it sank, 1 person who was onboard died, and ever since he's been a little more fucked than usual. He's done nothing but drink and get mad and yell ever since. Sure he did all of that stuff before on a weekly basis, but ever since it's been on about a daily basis. So for about a year he just didn't work whatsoever because he's been scared to go back on a boat, but since we're broke as shit he finally went back on the water for a week last week. Apparently they tormented him on the boat and kept playing tricks about the boat going down to fuck with him, so he came home and went on a 3 day bender, yelling and breaking shit for 3 days straight. My mom also happens to be pretty sick, and she's having lots of lung related problems,and she has to go in tomorrow overnight. And he wants me to stay tomorrow to keep him company. Now the thing is, I know if I stay, I'm probably not going to leave my room once so I don't see what difference it makes. On top of that I've already missed a lot of school recently, and while he was on his bender I didn't leave my room for 3 days, so I haven't eaten in 3 days, because I obviously didn't want to go out and deal with him screaming and breaking shit, so for that reason alone I think he deserves to be alone for a day. But the good guy inside of me wants to stay, what should I do?",

        "Question": "My (50F) son (15M) has become a far-right extremist and I have no idea what to do\n \n\nThrowaway account because this is too embarrassing.\n\nFor some context, my son is on the spectrum and has difficulty forming relationships with people as a result, although he still has a few in person friends. He's extremely intelligent, and knows many things, especially when he puts his mind to it. I also know he uses a lot of social media, since it's easier for him to make friends that way, however I did not monitor them which I regret doing.\n\nThe first red flag was when he was 13 and he began talking to me about various statistics which he said proved that the races were not equal, like crime and IQ, and when I pointed out there are societal reasons for this, he went on a rant and said that that these are actually biological (I still don't know what his sources are). At that time I just chalked it up to him not understanding the world very well and assumed he would grow out of it, but it has only gotten worse in every way.\n\nHe ordered a copy of Mein Kampf to our home. Fortunately, I saw the package and threw it away before he could get his hands on it, but when I confronted him about it, he started screaming and telling me that all his online friends and he started a reading group where they would read books together and they started with Mein Kampf, and that now he would be left out. I asked him if any of his friends at school were reading Mein Kampf, and he said that they were \"normies\" who didn't understand reality. I asked him if he thought I was a \"normie\" too, and he went on an incredibly misogynistic tirade against me saying that I was a \"whore\" and a \"roastie\" (I looked up what it meant later and I was horrified) for pursuing my career (which has provided our family with lots of money, including that he benefits from!) and for openly talking about my past relationships before I met his father, and also because his father and were never married and now separated. He told me he hated me for ruining his life by waiting \"so long\" to have children which is why he was on the spectrum and had difficulty talking to people (many of my friends had children at my age and they did not have children on the spectrum, not that it's a problem anyway). And that was only the beginning, I do not wish to go into more detail, but I couldn't even say anything to him as I broke down crying. I loved my son and we were so close until that point and never before had anything so mean ever been said to me. I couldn't handle it. I didn't understand why he would say such horrible things to me, or how he could have learned such ideas. I am a progressive, and especially feminist, and I thought I was raising our son to hold the same values, but he became the complete opposite of what I wanted him to be.\n\nIn the aftermath of this, I confiscated his computer and phone, although I did let him send one last message to his horrible \"friends\" since he wouldn't stop screaming to us about how he couldn't just abandon them without saying anything. However, this did not help in any way. He began spending more and more time outside the house, which I thought was a good thing and that maybe he was socializing with his peers who didn't accept this sort of thing. I also noticed over the next few months that he was getting more and more muscular, I was proud of him, but I also did not want him to believe he had to prove his \"manliness\" by getting big muscles, he then cursed me out and told me I was trying to make him a \"soyboy\" (a term I did not know and had to look up) so he didn't care what I had to say. Eventually I find out he somehow managed to find a skinhead gang after school and they workout together... after I saw him with them, I screamed at him and then at them that they as grown men should stop trying to manipulate a teenage boy and there was no reason for him to spend time with strange men in their 20s and 30s.\n\nAfter that, I was very strict about everything he was doing. I would pick him up and drop him off, even though it meant I needed to take off time from work to do so. When I dropped him off at home, I locked the doors to make sure he could not escape before returning to work. However, this did not work either, and eventually I was called by the school principle who let us know that he and his school friends (who he has also convinced to become Nazis now!) had beaten a group of POC boys up and that he and his friends would receive a suspension as a result. I was so livid. I could not imagine the fact I was raising a future criminal, and he told me that I was a traitor for not being proud of him for being stronger than them and for beating up \"murderers of our people, rapists of our women, and invaders of our lands\". No reason can get to him, and no discipline can get to him. And now I AM SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES TOO, all my friends now assume I must be a racist because of my son, and don't want to spend time with me anymore. The other parents at the school avoid me. People who used to be friendly are now cold. I have no idea how to deal with this situation, can anyone here on Reddit give me good advice?",

I have not been a victim of sexual abuse.  I am not transgender.  I feel like a woman, and would be unhappy with a penis.  (Any ideas what could be up with me here?)  Physically and mentally, I am a woman; however recently I have come to wonder if it is possible to be psychologically one gender but *socially* the other, if that makes sense.  The way a man treats a male friend is very different than a woman treats a woman, a woman treats a man, or a man treats a woman.  There is a specific kind of friendship and interaction I have only ever observed between men, and it saddens me that it is unlikely I will ever fully experience that type of bond.\n\nBesides this lack of sex drive and such, I am not much of a people person.  I have my one good friend, and that was all I needed, but I\u2019m losing him through no intention of either of us.  I have made a few work friends, even having gone to parties with some and out to a restaurant for drinks with another, but find it hard to be with people.\n\n---\n\nWe were originally \u201cpen-pals\u201d (keyboard pals).  I was in university and heavily struggling.  It turns out I had some wild anemia that should have left me completely incapable (but somehow didn\u2019t quite) and some fucky hormones that were making it hard to function, but I didn\u2019t get those answers when I needed them.  I felt very overwhelmed and alone, ended up on a penpal-finding site, and he messaged me.  At first, I was annoyed by his comment that he, too, knew how it felt, to feel like one was getting left behind in a world that was moving on too fast, but kept that thought to myself and kept the conversation going.  Turns out, he really did know, better than I.\n\nWe became great friends.  We could tell each other anything.  I learned he was ill, lost most his friends because of it (when he couldn\u2019t party, the partiers left; when he couldn\u2019t work, those relationships dissolved; when he couldn\u2019t play cricket, his teammates were no longer teammates).  He left home at 17 to escape an abusive alcoholic father, worked so hard on his education, got his degree, and I imagine life was finally becoming okay.  He only got to work a few years at the career he fought for before he became ill, and eventually couldn\u2019t physically perform regardless of how hard he pushed.  He and I found each other and became pen-pals a few years later, at which point he was mobile within his home and usually managed to get outside a little bit once every few days.\n\nHe was (is?) fun and upbeat, charismatic, witty.  I was surprised to eventually learn that he had gone through some sexual and emotional abuse/trauma that left him with body dysmorphia, feeling worthless and unlovable, on-and-off suicidal with several botched attempts.  Even before this came out, we were very close, and it made me more comfortable with being open about my own struggles with the idea of sex.  Our problems here were very different, but somehow also very much the same.\n\nYears of phone calls and photos and daily text-chats went by.  He\u2019d often express his regret that I wasn\u2019t from somewhere closer (\u201cshame you\u2019re not local\u201d); we\u2019d talk about how nice it would be if I could just pop in for a cup of tea and a visit, sometimes.  We\u2019d discussed the possibility of me coming to meet him, someday.  Perhaps that amount of long-distance communication is odd and unhealthy.  What do you think?  Can someone really be friends with a person they\u2019ve never met?  Were we too co-dependent?  \n\nAnyway\u2026 a couple years went by, and I ended up going traveling through a few countries that were close together.  At the last country, I ended up on his doorstep.  He didn\u2019t know I was coming, and I had found a few accommodations (hostels and campgrounds) nearby that I\u2019d intended to check out and check into one of once I arrived.  I thought he\u2019d probably chat with me on his doorstep, and if things went well I would come back and spend more time with him other days.  To my surprise, this beautiful, generous, vulnerable human who had no idea I was coming *trusted* me, opened up his little home to me, and made it clear that I was welcome to anything in it.  Though he is just renting one room in the house, I ended up there at a point where 3 others had just left and a fourth was in the process of moving out and no longer lived there, so we had privacy and the run of the house.\n\nWe watched movies together and played a board game he ordered.  We sat around and drank tea and listened to music and chatted and were our odd selves.  I had recently joined a cricket team in my home country, and he helped me practice his sport a bit outside.  He wanted to make sure I explored and did some touristy things, and would find me maps and send me off on adventures he couldn\u2019t follow on.  As I walked out the door, he\u2019d be grabbing me my the backpack to stuff in snacks and juice and the like.  He told me what foods I should try and where to get them, and once when I got home from a hike, I found he had made me a big pot of pasta.  I know that took a good bit of effort with his limited energy.  I felt so cared about.  I loved so well, and was so well-loved.  But, of course, I had to go back to my own country.  Those were a happy 10 days that I\u2019ve been chasing ever since.\n\nWe continued chatting via text and phone call, sharing photos and videos.  A few months later, we planned for me to return the next summer.  We thought I might get a YM Visa down the road, so I could live and work out there for a couple years, but I\u2019m getting older and trying to start a career, and am only eligible for that visa until I am 30, and I can\u2019t see this being a possibility in the next few years, so I guess that\u2019s that, then.  Yet another thing the pandemic ripped from me.\n\n After I left that first time, I kept becoming even fonder of him.  I loved him; I knew that for a long time.  He felt like a cool older brother, sort of, and I loved him that way.  But also I was discovering it was a versatile kind of love.  I *could* love him like a sibling.  I could love him as if he were my son, and I were ferociously maternally protective.  I could love him as a friend.  I felt a sort of attraction I\u2019d never felt, before, too.  I could love him romantically, if I so chose.  So I did, and once I spilled my guts out to him, he eventually came around to the idea as well.  I didn\u2019t push him; he just grew into the idea on his own.  We we became even closer, in this strange new way.  Eventually, I felt willing \u2013\u2013 excited, even \u2013\u2013 to try to explore some physical intimacy and sexuality with him.\n\nThe pandemic started getting attention a couple weeks before my flight would have left, and he urged me to cancel my ticket and try again when it was sorted out and safer in a few weeks.  Boy, if we knew then what we know now\u2026\n\nIt\u2019s been 4 years since I\u2019ve seen him.  He\u2019s gotten gradually sicker the whole time, which was somewhat expected.  Most days he\u2019s not really well enough to chat back-and-forth, but will still text me to let me know he\u2019s okay.  On lucid/focused/better (never \u201cgood\u201d) days we chat and I see his old self peek out from time to time.  He is vaccinated, but caught COVID a while back, which also did not help things. I thought that post-covid would be a good time to slip in a visit, during the window which he had the antibodies from fighting off the infection and would be protected by both the vaccine and natural immunity.  He said he was too sick to visit (I think he\u2019s self-conscious about his situation; things must be unravelling over there) and too scared, and I watched that little window where I could visit without putting him in danger slowly close.\n\nI know I won\u2019t see him again, now.  I\u2019ve tried to come to terms with that for the last few years, but keep finding myself picking up scraps of hope.  I wish I could move on.  I\u2019ve tried.  I have a hard time finding people I can make connections with, and he was one of the precious few.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever experience a romantic connection again.  I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever feel ready to explore intimacy again.  I don\u2019t want to die a virgin, but I can\u2019t bring myself to even consider touching anyone else, yet.  Maybe the right person will come along, and be patient enough to stand by me for years as a friend, until I feel safe and secure and emotionally connected/intimate enough to try.\n\nI just can\u2019t stop thinking of all those little pockets of happiness we\u2019ve had, and all the happiness I never got the chance to have.  I imagined getting home from work and crawling into bed behind him, or making dinner while he kept me company.  I thought about the movies and music I wanted to share with him, all the cups of tea I wanted to drink with him.  I think about wanting to wake up to that bright face and its absurdly mobile eyebrows (he emotes with these in the most adorable, exaggerated way, lol), that beautifully rough voice and its prickly accent.  I never met his mum, but we sort-of interacted, and we somewhat communicated through him.  Early on, when we were just starting to get close as keyboard-pals, I guess he told his mum and sister about me.  They asked about me a few times over the year, and supposedly expressed fondness.  I\u2019ve asked about them some, too, and get the impression that I would get along with his little family very well.  As creepy as I\u2019m sure this is, I looked forward to meeting them, and am sad I will not.  I always thought I\u2019d bring his Mum a little pot of zinnias to first meet her, and we\u2019d probably end up drinking tea and talking about bits and bobs and\u2026\n\nanyway, I\u2019m rambling.  It\u2019s just a weird thing.  I always knew this relationship was a long shot and could never actually last, but I wanted to steal a few more happy moments in this life, and thought I could help supply some better moments to him, too, and it\u2019s hard watching that opportunity become an impossibility and not knowing whether I will ever feel such a connection again, or if I even want to feel such a connection with someone else.  I know this whole thing has been absolutely absurd from the beginning, but kind of wonderful, too.\n\n---\n\nWas this relationship always unhealthy?  Was it weird?  How do I get over it?  How do I move on?\n\nAny idea what's up with my sexuality?  What can I do about that?  I don't want my broken sexuality.  I want to be able to explore.\n\nWhat about my thought of being \"socially male\"?  Any idea what that might be?  Is there a term for it?",

In most circumstances/ with most people ( or Layla solo) I wouldn\u2019t mind but I really do not want to spend any amount of nights with her kids.. I love them. I truly do. I just can\u2019t handle how naughty they are.. The younger one isn\u2019t that bad but the older child, Keith (8),who I suspect is neurodivergent, does not listen, he is very rude, has little to no manners, and is mischievous in scary ways. Part of me wants to support her because she\u2019s a single mom but the other part of me doesn\u2019t want to ruin this time away from me, my husband or kids.. Because of the last trip we took together where Keith was caught stealing, set a garbage can on fire, and wouldn\u2019t listen to Layla at all; My husband was a firm no. so, that\u2019s what we\u2019ll do but I don\u2019t know how to tell my sister without this coming off really bad..

I go to the bar TO TALK to other people that don't work with me or live in my house.   There are dozens of people I talk to at our local bar.  There are several friendship groups that occasionally invite me to stuff because I know them through the bar.\n\nThis is difficult for introverted people.  Not only do you have to put yourself out there, some people won't always like you or want to talk to you.   That's life.   Its also difficult if nobody is up there.  If no one is there, I have just one or two and chat with the bartender (all of whom I know.)   This is more difficult in packed clubs with a hundred people.\n\nEvery serious relationship I've ever had happened when I wasn't \"trying\" to meet someone.  Its almost like trying too hard messes everything up.   Just be yourself and be open to making friends and talking to other people.  The rest will happen eventually",

        "Question": "Should I break off the wedding? Fianc\u00e9 hates my dad to the point of hurting me\nEdit: explaining what fianc\u00e9 did to provoke dads behavior-he was having a bad day at work and yelled and was cussing not really at me-but in general. He also threw a drawer straight down on the floor because of how worked up he was. Once again none of it was at me or directed towards me in any way. But my dad felt like you shouldn\u2019t talk to my daughter in that way-\u201cshe\u2019s a lady.\u201d When he confronted my fianc\u00e9 my fianc\u00e9 said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have acted that way BUT-I was mad. My dad blew up because he felt since my fianc\u00e9 had to throw a BUT in there-he wasn\u2019t actually that sorry.\n\n\nI was raised by a single dad. My dad has a lot of faults-one of him is the way he talks to people is disrespectful and he has a temper. He never physically hurts anyone but he\u2019s not afraid of cussing someone out. I know he has wrongs but I also see the damaged side of him and what he went through after mom left. So I still love him for all the years he was hurt and raised me. \n\nAbout 2 months ago my dad got in a huge fight with my fianc\u00e9. My fianc\u00e9 was initially in the wrong. Dad got to the point where he went to my fianc\u00e9s work and cussed him out in front of his boss. And then went and told my fianc\u00e9s parents all his issues he has with me marrying my fianc\u00e9. \n\nI called my dad and yelled at him and told him he went way to far and didn\u2019t talk to him hardly for like 2 or 3 weeks. But I still love dad. As wrong as he may be. My fianc\u00e9 has not dropped it since. He brings it up about once a week how much of a jerk my dad is and how much he hates him. After I told him he needed to let it go because it was causing us to fight he stopped talking about it as much. But still brings it up occasionally. I try to let him get his temper out but then he will say something like I never want your dad at the house again. If you want to see him it can\u2019t be on my property. And I think to myself he hates my dad so much that he\u2019s willing to hurt my relationship with my dad because of what he did? Like I feel at that point he\u2019s ok with hurting me. \n\nI try to explain to my fianc\u00e9 that I know my dad did a bad thing but I feel he doesn\u2019t care about my feelings when he\u2019s making me take half the punishment by saying I don\u2019t want your dad to ever come over and see our new house. But he sees it as me defending my dads behavior. I\u2019ve tried to make him see my perspective for months. And I\u2019m also trying to register how much my dad embarrassed him and of how my fianc\u00e9 is acting is justified in any way\u2026..\n\nShould I break this or not?",

We have been together for almost 6 years, as the title states he is a dealer. I have been trying to encourage him to get a job for years, and he acts like a complete man child about it, he has a temper problem when it comes to any kind of authority over him. Other than that we really don\u2019t get into disagreements so it makes this harder for me. When we started dating we only did it because it was what we had to do if we wanted food or shelter, but now he\u2019s became lazy. He just wants fast easy ways to get rich (y\u2019all don\u2019t even know how many crypto scams I have prevented him from giving our savings to) and not put in effort for anything he wants in life. Obviously I can\u2019t just change him and make him work, but idk what to do anymore and I\u2019m tired of it. To make things worse I\u2019m a very introverted person and don\u2019t have any near friends I could just move in with if I decided to leave. I hate saying I\u2019m with him only for financial reasons because I do really love him, but ultimately if I had the money I would have been gone long ago. He just keeps saying he\u2019s going to get a job as an \u201centrepreneur\u201d but as I said he wants everything handed to him with no effort.  Anyways what can or should I do?",

A budgie/parakeet and a canary. They both live in separate cages. Their cages are kept in a back sunroom. It seems I forgot to lock the outside access door when I went out (have had lots on my mind recently). When home I found they had been stabbed, cut up, inside their cages, blood and feathers. No valuables are kept in this room and I'm unsure if anything is missing. This is quite disturbing.\n\nThey are only small birds but were pets.

        "Question": "I just want my name change to be respected.\nI\u2019m going to try to make all of this simple to you guys since it\u2019s rocket-science to my family that I wanted a feminine name and gave it to myself. I just wanted to feel satisfied. \n\nI was born with a name that I did not like, so I changed it last year when I was 19. I\u2019m 20 now and my family still can\u2019t get with the program. I changed my name because I always hated it. My mom named me something so masculine. Before you guys get on me, I\u2019m aware that gender neutral names exist but this wasn\u2019t that. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cJordan\u201d or \u201cAlex\u201d situation. She named me after a famous male actor because she thought he was sexy and she\u2019d never heard of a girl with his name before. She said I was going to be named that no matter if I was a boy or girl. Then, to make shit even worse, she gave me a feminine middle name. I\u2019d been getting comments and questions about my name since I was in elementary school and I was seven years old telling myself that I\u2019d change my name because I was just so tired. I just wanted to not be embarrassed. \n\nThe last straw that lead me to change my name was when I was at work and a guy asked me my name. I told him and he raised a brow and asked \u201cLike the actor?\u201d and I told him yes. Then, he proceeded to say \u201cWell, you\u2019re still beautiful anyway\u201d and left. That was when I started the process of legally filing to change my name. \n\nWhen the name change did finalize and happen, my mom just couldn\u2019t understand my choice. She compared it to how transgender people change their gender (I couldn\u2019t get a grip on her comparison) and she compared my name to her name, saying she\u2019d been teased all her life but her name is very much just feminine and Biblical. People know she\u2019s a woman before they see her face but I had people thinking I was a guy before they ever even saw me because my name was so masculine.  She said I should\u2019ve took that as a good thing and used every excuse in the book to avoid understanding my perspective. She even said it was disrespectful. Disrespectful for me to want a girly name so that I can live within my girly self? Disrespectful for me to not want to feel bad when people made unnecessary comments and said that my birth name was a \u201cboy name\u201d? \n\nRegardless of me changing my name, my family still continues to call me by my old name. I\u2019ve tried to reenforce it but they just won\u2019t listen. However, they always expect me to respect them but deliberately choose to ignore my wishes. Only a FEW people in my family try to respect my name change and best believe I can only count on one hand. I\u2019ve received better support from friends. My dad told me on the phone that he would still call me by my birth name but he still mixes it up and calls me by both names. My big sister says she\u2019s not calling me by my new name because she\u2019s not used to it and I don\u2019t look like the name that I\u2019ve picked. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019ve done this for no reason. \n\nI\u2019m going to the military sometime this year and I\u2019ve made it a goal to get this respect thing situated. I\u2019m old enough to receive the same respect the adults in my family expect from me so if they\u2019re still doing this to me when I join, I\u2019m cutting them off. I even told myself that they\u2019d be banned from my wedding if I get married and even the birth of my children if I have any if they can\u2019t respect my choice. My wedding invites and baby shower invites would say my new name and I don\u2019t need any confusion or embarrassment when my family meets my future husband\u2019s family. The way my family is acting, they\u2019re going to miss out on all that stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s not THAT hard to call someone what they want to be called and I don\u2019t know what I can do to change them from being ignorant.\n\nEDIT: Why would my mom throw trans people in the mix when if I did want to be trans, I\u2019d have to take one less step considering the fact that my name literally used to be masculine? She set me up with a masculine name anyway so I wouldn\u2019t have had to change my name if I wanted to be a male. It makes no sense. Give a girl a masculine name and then get mad at her for wanting a feminine name instead? Am I wrong?",

        "Question": "My partner split up with me, 6 months later texting me about dental bills\nWhen I lived with my partner I paid for a discounted dental plan for both of us through my employer's scheme. He insisted it wasn't working between us and I needed to move out. I texted him a month later to say I needed to take him from my insurance. He asked if he could pay to keep me on it. I said I'd look into it, I did and it was pretty clear that it was a plan for me and my partner so I notified HR who changed all of my policies to be me only. I didn't tell him as I was trying to move on and not have too much contact.\n\nA few months later he asked if he was still on my insurance. I said he wasn't and he texted me back saying I didn't tell him and now he has dental bills. I did tell him but I also told him I'd look into keeping him on and didn't update him.\n\nSome time later he texted me about how his energy bills are going to bankrupt him.\n\nToday he asked me again if he was definitely not on my insurance. Of course I said no and then he told me he'd got a \u00a33k bill to pay. I told him when we broke up he was no longer eligible for cover. He texted back \"oh dear\", then suggested I could move in until he's paid for dental work. \n\nI just feel incredibly guilty about it. If he was still with me the insurance would cover some of the expenses. Just the idea of him struggling with everything is eating away at me. I almost want to just send him a cheque to cover his bills.",

        "Question": "How can i explain to my gf that adding a bathroom to a new home isnt a priority?\nMe and my gf are in the final stages of purchasing a new home and we have all kinds of ideas to improve and customize an already renovated  home to our liking.  It\u2019s a single family 2 bathroom 4-1/2 bedroom house. In the top floor where we are going to have our master bedroom does not have a bathroom. My gf always wanted a third bathroom to be added which isnt a problem to me, because the two bathrooms are in the middle and basement floor respectively. \n\nUpon getting the house inspection done, it has been revealed that the water heater, and hvac system is 3-4 years past its  life expectancy and i would like to have that replaced before all other improvements are made. To me, it takes more of a priority over a bathroom because #1, a third bathroom isnt absolutely needed, Its more of a want imo and #2, the other two bathrooms have been renovated and look very good aesthetically. \n\nMy gf doesnt look at the hvac situation as seriously as i do and is dead set on this bathroom. She doesnt seem to be budging on this. What do you guys think? Btw, i would do both repairs/additions at the same time, but money plays a factor. The price to add a bathroom could be the same or more as the hvac system. We haven\u2019t moved in or gotten proper estimates yet.",

I\u2019m now 24 and the teacher is suddenly emailing me.\nThis is my first time using Reddit, so apologies in advance if i\u2019m doing anything incorrectly and sorry if this is too long.\n\nI was very close to a teacher at school when i was 15/16. She was a woman (29) and so am I. I suffered badly from panic attacks, anxiety, grief and depression. She would always comfort me and help me through it. She was caring and very good at teaching her subject. But some of her behaviour left me feeling very confused and uncomfortable. \n\nShe would discuss her personal life with me, including details about her relationship with her boyfriend and her sex life. She\u2019d say to me that i was one of her favourites, compliment my appearance sometimes and touch me often - like cradling my face or stroking my hair. She\u2019d often stare at me intently during class/around the school and mistakenly say my name when talking to another student or compliment me to other students.\n\nI found all of this really overwhelming and her intimidating. This led to me getting palpitations around her, feeling sick, weak/shaky or like i\u2019d pass out in her class. I couldn\u2019t eat my lunch before her lessons because i was afraid of how her behaviour made me feel. I always thought I just had a crush on her because she was a great teacher, attractive, and young. It made me question my sexuality at the time. \n\nAfter I left school in 2015, we stayed in touch for a few years through her school email very occasionally. I then found out that she\u2019d left the school and heard nothing from her for 4 years.\n\nI\u2019m now 24 and suddenly a few days ago, she emailed me through her personal email and I was shocked. I got the same feelings of nausea, shakiness and breathlessness that I got in her class. She said in the email that because it was International Women\u2019s Day, she thought of me and wanted to check how I am (odd?). She told me that she\u2019d left the school and also left teaching and she hopes i\u2019m \u201ccontinuing to be amazing\u201d.\n\nWhen i told my therapist about this all, she said that I had been groomed by my teacher at 15 and I was made to feel special by her, which then made me feel like I had a crush on her. \n\nI\u2019m finding it difficult to process because i thought this teacher was a good person and someone i missed, looked up to and loved. Am I in denial that I was groomed? Did she take advantage of me? I feel like what if I\u2019m making things up and the lines are blurry. The idea of \u201cbeing groomed\u201d makes me feel very upset, angry, almost \u2018dirty\u2019 and traumatised :(",

        "Question": "Came across my son's internet browsing history and I feel disgusted\nI am a 37 year old single mom to a 15 year old son. I was an orphan and was raised by my aunt and uncle who I didn't have a great relationship with and ended up running away at the age of 16. For 6 years after that I had been involved in a series of bad relationships and bad decisions and once my son was born, I promised myself that I would raise my son in a proper manner.\n\nI inculcated in him the idea of being open and sharing even if he he did something wrong. I never believed in punishment and always openly spoke and discussed things if he did something wrong. I worked as a waitress and for a while as a  stripper and have been subject to harassment quite often.  I was really disgusted with some of the men and I made sure that I thought my son the importance of respecting the human body. Growing up I was comfortable being nude around him till around a couple of years back where I started being a little conservative. I still pretty  comfortable being in underwear around him or walking around the house with no bra under my clothes.\n\nLast week, my laptop wasn't working, so I decided to use my son's computer. He wasn't home that day and I tried calling him to ask him if it was ok to use his computer. He didn't answer and I desperately wanted to get some work done, so I decided to use it anyway. Luckily I knew his pin and I was able to login. A part of me knew that as a teenager, he probably would be seeing porn, so I kept myself ready not to be judgemental and I even went to the extent of opening up an incognito window. I didn't realize that even in incognito, the auto suggest showed history. I was appalled when I saw my son has been watching incest themed porn, specifically mother and son.\n\nI don't know what to do and how to confront him. One one hand I don't want to show that I broke his trust and accessed his personal computer. I've personally done some research and also found out that this sort of porn  was not really uncommon . Ever since that day, I've been feeling uncomfortable about being around my son and feel a little violated . I want to talk to him about it, but I'm unsure how to go about it .\n\nEdit: Thank you for your advice, I've decided that I will see a therapist for myself first. Some of you pointed out that I shouldn't be roaming around in my underwear in front of my son , but do you think that is really something that has gotten inside my sons head? For e.g. How do we define what is appropriate or what is in appropriate? \n\nIt could be that I am over thinking things. My biggest fear is losing my son. He has been a constant in my life and it scares me knowing that I might push him away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

        "Question": "EX GF spread false allegations that I'm an abuser and it cost me my dream job.\nTitle says it all. My ex (as of 19 months ago) contacted me about a month ago about a kitchen utensil she wanted back. I told her I would get it to her but was busy with my job, and wouldn't be able to get it to her until the next week. When I returned from my trip, she had made an account on social media impersonating me and making fun and slandering my name. I told her to take it down or that I would get the authorities involved and she called me an abuser and asked me to leave her alone.\n\n2 hours later my friend calls me and tells me about a video on her story that states that I'm an abuser. I go to the police and do the legal stuff.\n\n3 weeks later (yesterday) I received a message informing me that I was no longer employed, and was wished the best of luck. This job was my DREAM. It was the perfect job for me, the one I'd grew up wanting. I called a coworker and they agreed that it was because of her messaging my boss and telling him i abused her when we dated and am still now. Now I'm in debt, can't pay bills, and feel lost and defeated. I'm blown away that this whole thing got this far, and I don't know what to do.\n\nTLDR: Ex gf accused me of abuse back when we dated.

        "Question": "How do I ask school admins to change playground rules?\nI have a really great 10 year old 4th grader. Smart, funny, kind and helpful. I may be biased but overall a mature and lovely person. She attends a newer public school, part of the inaugural kindergarten class so there for 5 years now. The school just put in a playground a few weeks ago and obviously the kids are all very excited. \n\nApparently, the admins have decided to put some rules in place, which makes sense in general. However, they have also assigned a group of students to be the \"safety committee\" to make sure the rules are being followed. These kids walk around during recess with clipboards and write names down. This doesn't sit right with me to begin with, but I'm having a hard time articulating why.\n\nI have not received a copy of the rules, but my kid says things like no running (um ok, shouldn't kids run and play outside?), 2 kids on the bars at a time, 5 \"tricks\" on bars (like flipping over), 20 swings on the swings. So the safety committee stands around with clipboards and write down names of rule violaters and if your name gets on the list 3 times you go to the principal. \n\nThis by itself just sounds so stupid to me so I'm looking for advice on how to approach this with the school. \n\nAdd to it that it seems no one informed the kids about the safety committee so all of a sudden there's just a bunch of narcs floating around giving kids anxiety about the threat of being in trouble.\n\nTop it all off with the fact that one of the kids on the safety committee was bullying my kid last year (nothing major but it was a friend that was jealous my kid was starting to spend time with other friends and bad enough that the bully was moved to a different class). So this bully is now targeting my kid and basically standing there watching them specifically every day. My kid tried to speak to admins without bringing up the bully specifically, just the rules and committee in general, and was basically told these are the rules and to deal. \n\nToday the bully told my kids teacher that they are watching closely since my kid breaks rules often. My kids teacher said that doesn't seem fair but didn't do much about it and suggested my kid write a letter to the admins. \n\nAny advice on how to approach this and make strong arguments against a safety committee of kids and general dumb playground rules?",

What are their teachers doing during recess? Why aren't they able to supervise? Giving kids little jobs like Line Leader or Table Cleaner is a normal thing to do, but you have the kids switch out jobs every day or so, so everyone gets a turn, and you don't give some kids authority over other kids. There's no way that doesn't lead to bullying. I can almost guarantee that your kid isn't the only one getting unfairly targeted, so if you ask around the other parents you could get a whole group together to bring this up at a PTA meeting or something.",

        "Question": "I met up with my son after four years of no contact.\n \n\nOriginal Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/duplicates/11lcng9/my\\_son22m\\_cut\\_contact\\_with\\_me\\_43f\\_four\\_years\\_ago/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/duplicates/11lcng9/my_son22m_cut_contact_with_me_43f_four_years_ago/)\n\nFor the few that gave me actual advice, I went to meet up with my son without Max or my daughter. It was at a local coffee shop. I found him sitting in one of the booths at the coffee shop. He was on his phone. I was really scared. A part of me wanted to tackle him with a hug and beg for his forgiveness. Another part of me, wanted to leave before he noticed me. I said his name to get his attention. He didn't even leave his seat; he just looked at me and said hi. I asked if I could sit. I started asking about how is he doing. He said he was fine. I was about to apologize, but he interrupted me by saying, \"Before you apologize, I want to understand how the relationship between Max and you even started.\"\n\nI started telling him everything. When it came to mentioning my meet-ups, he interjected me and started asking me questions that were difficult to answer. He asked \"So all the times that you were going out you were lying to me about where were you going. Weren't you?\" I nodded. \"What about the times I asked to spend time with you? Did you lie to me so you meet up with Max instead?\" I started tearing up. It was hard being there. \"Did you miss out on events to be with Max? What about my birthday?\" That's when I started crying. He told me to save my tears. He said he figured that out soon after he learned about the relationship with Max. He just wanted to hear it from me. He then asked me if I was still with Max. I told him I was married to him and I have a daughter with him. He seemed to need a minute to process that.\n\nThen he started speaking. He told me he never had an issue with me dating or meeting someone. In fact, he hoped I found love. He understands that I needed companionship and a type of love he couldn't offer as my son. He told me throughout all these years he felt conflicted because both Max and I were both consenting adults and adults have a right to find happiness. My son admitted he shouldn't Max and was glad he didn't press charges. He said despite all of that, they were some things that he can't get over. He told me he can't get over the fact that I didn't take him into consideration when it came to pursuing the relationship. It was also hurtful to realize that I would value a romantic relationship to the point of being willing to throw away a close relationship with him for it. If I had the attitude of being done raising him and finally pursuing my own life, then that's valid, according to him. However, I would have no right to want to have a close relationship with him in return. Again, that's what he said he believes. He told me he wouldn't have forgotten me when he left for college. He would have wanted me to move close to him after he got a job if he couldn't move close to me. In this ideal world we would live close by so he we could still see each other even after he had a family.\n\nHe said he loves himself and his life too much to have back in my life.. My son said he works as a mechanical engineer now. He is engaged to the love of his life. She was also raised by a single mom like him until she was 16 when her stepdad into the picture. Both of them have welcomed him into the family. He told me his future in-laws and his fiance are his family now. He said he was getting a job near them.\n\nHe finally admitted that he just wanted closure before permanently cutting me off. He told me not to contact him or his family at all. He made it clear he wouldn't be there for me at my last stage of life or even come to my funeral. He made it clear he won't even hold my hand when I pass away. I won't have the privilege of knowing his fiance or his future kids. He made it clear that if his half-sister ever contacts him as an adult he'll be upfront on why he doesn't want a relationship with her. He said good bye to me and left. I cried so hard that I got the attention of the people in the coffee shop. I was crying on the way back home. I don't even know how therapy can even help. I never felt so much emotional pain in my life before. What do I do now?",

        "Question": "(Update): My ex-bestfriend, who is married to my ex-husband hired me to make a cake for her son's birth.\n Hi, guys. I have read your advice and suggestions. You all made some really good points. So, I decided to talk to my mom about it. I just needed her insights about this matter. She told me I should do what I want to do. My boyfriend also encouraged me to take the order. He says that if I had to stay to organize the dessert table he would be there for me. I took the order. And it turns out, it was my ex husband\u2019s idea to hire me. Because one of his colleagues recommended my services to him. And it was sort of short notice so I had to rush this. Anyways, I kept it strictly about business. I did take the payment in advance just like some of you have mentioned. I always ask for advance payments. I mostly maintained communication through email. I have an assistant who is also a family friend of mine to handle all communications. My ex-bsf tried many times to meet with me in person, but I told her to just email me because I do have cake orders for other people too. I only had to meet her 1 time in person regarding the order. She sent me the details of the party over the email. \n\nAnd like I mentioned it was a huge order. I didn\u2019t just have to make a birthday cake for the baby (it is pokemon themed). There were also cake pops, cupcakes and macarons. Luckily, I had my friend Marie over for some help (yes, I did pay her). So, like usual I went to deliver the cakes and other stuff for the party. There was already a table set at the venue. My boyfriend, Josh (35M) came with me to support me and to keep me away from my ex-husband and ex-bsf as much as possible. As I was busy with myself, my ex approached me and said hello. Ngl, seeing him after so many years my heart just stopped. This man has given me the worst pain you could possibly give to a human. I am glad I held my composure. I also said hello back. He tried to have a small talk with me by saying that he is sorry about how things went down and what he said and also I looked better than the last time he saw me. Then he drops a big bomb, he said all these years he has thought of me, wondering what I was doing even though he is happy with his married life. I was silent. I didn\u2019t say a word. He just kept spewing that he misses me and my cooking. My homemade french onion soup is still his favorite. He misses that every time he gets sick with a flu. I didn\u2019t know what to say. At that moment Josh noticed that my ex was making me uncomfortable and he rushed towards me with a fake emergency. He asked if I was ok, I said yes. \n\nAfter the table setting was done, I was about to leave, that\u2019s when I saw my ex-FIL along with other guests. He noticed me and came to give me a hug. My ex-FIL is a very humble man. In fact he was the only man who was on my side when I was going through a divorce with his son. He looked really happy to see me and asked me how I was. He started to chat with me. I talked to him about my business and he gave me some advice. He even talked to my boyfriend. He called Josh a \u201cpretty standard guy\u201d (whatever that means). Ex-FIL was nice and said he would suggest my services to his friends too. He insisted that I stay until lunch is served. I said no a couple of times but he managed to convince me. I only stayed for 1 more hour or so. But I was fine. I did notice that my ex-bsf was eyeing me from the corner. I was fine because Josh was beside me the whole time. I chatted with some guests. They appreciated my service. I didn\u2019t have any more conversations with my ex. I didn\u2019t even stay for the cake cutting. I left the first chance I got but my assistant stayed to make sure everything was fine and for the clean up. \n\nIt was overwhelming for me. I saw some of my old friends and my in-laws. My MIL avoided me and some of my old friends just said hello. Later that day I got a message from my ex-bsf on my work email that she liked my service and that her guests really liked my cakes and desserts. She also said sorry. That\u2019s not where it ends. I got to know from my friend Marie, who is still in contact with some of my old friend group that my ex-bsf is not happy with her marriage. When my ex and her are in public they would often fight a lot. They also fight on the day of their kid\u2019s birthday. Tbh I just told her to not bring me the gossip about her. But the silver lining is I got a huge fat check lol. I can finally buy a new sugar printer or maybe a good quality oven. Also, I just want to appreciate my boyfriend Josh. He has been incredibly supportive of me. He has protected me from my ex and ex-bsf like a knight. I think he deserves his own cake from me. \ud83d\ude09 And I know a lot of you told me not to take it. But I guess I am just a greedy Mr. Krabs who cares more about the money rather than being classy hehe. But this is the last time I will be taking any orders from them. I know they have a 3 yr old daughter whose birthday will be in 2 months. I think they might try to hire me again. I will not take it if that happens. \n\nP. S. Yes my ex-bsf did try to communicate with me during the party but I managed to avoid it thanks to Josh and my ex-FIL. My ex-FIL knows about my situation and my discomfort with my ex-bsf. He kept me busy with small talk.",

Help!\nMy son (20) has been with his girlfriend (20) for about 5 months and she's just moved in with us as she doesn't get along with her parents but she comes with issues that I'm not used to or know how to deal with.\n\nShe's not working so my son and I are supporting her. I've been trying to help her find work but she's not making an effort.\n\nWhen it was me and my son, I'd put food in the fridge (cooked meats, salads, bread, sandwich wraps etc) and he'd take care of himself but his girlfriend always asks for cooked meals for lunch and dinner and to make it worse, she won't eat left overs or the same thing twice in one day. Won't even eat them the next day.\n\nWhen I do cook meals, she loads her plate up so full that she can't eat it all. Ends up in the fridge but as I said, she won't eat left overs so it gets thrown out.\n\nIn the mornings when I first wake up, I like to sit in peace and have my coffee, watch the morning news etc but she right there non stop talking and doesn't seem to take a breath.\n\nShe's not a bad person. She's actually a lovely girl who clearly hasn't had the best upbringing.

Then got next to the car and refresh the app, if there is a tracker in or on the car you'll notice a new device appearing in the app. Look at the distance which is in meters, then walk around to different sides of the car, and look at the distance. The lower the distance means the closer you are to the Air Tag. The app should display Air Tag so it should be really easy to find in the app when looking at it. I'd also recommend maybe doing this search with her car at least 75 feet from all other cars and bluetooth device that are on phones and cars. It should be super easy to find.

        "Question": "Should I feel bad for not wanting to help my parents past age 25?\nMy parents recently told me that they cannot afford certain things and they need help, I live with them and I\u2019m 20 so I help out with bills every so often, I\u2019m the youngest I have an older sister and an older brother who both drained them of money for college, trips, etc. my brother has nothing to do with my parents because they drove him away and my sister works on and off but they don\u2019t expect her to contribute, she also dropped out of college that they were paying for. \n\nI recently started my own business and work full time so I can eventually go to school or fund my business for more return. They know I have a lot of money saved for my future and told me I will have to start helping out because my sister refuses to work full time and make money, they also don\u2019t expect her to pay bills or rent. \n\nThey ended up telling me that i have to pay them money for retirement because they had expectations that the child with the most money will take care of them, I barely started my life and it seems unfair for the youngest child to have to take care of my parents who are mid 60s when I am just learning my way around my personal life and business. I feel a huge burden on my shoulders because they made bad financial decisions and they are expecting money from me to fund their vacations , groceries for everyone , bills , cooking, cleaning etc. im starting to think of moving out but I feel bad because they did give birth to me and take care of me when I was a kid. \n\nI think they should ask my sister (22 f) to help or my brother (30 m), I can\u2019t take on their financial burden as I have to think about my future, I want a family of my own and children.\n\nWhat do I tell them?

        "Question": "I (34F) caught my dad (71M) watching bestiality porn and found lots more in his history.\nMy parents (71M & 69F) are retired but my mother runs market stall of her crafts in our town once a month.\n\nI work freelance and have been abroad for the last years. I am back visiting them for a while and staying with them, I am sleeping in their guest bedroom in the basement where my dads PC also is. My mother is a technophobe, literally never uses a PC, doesn't even have an email address.\n\nI was helping my mum on her stall today, my dad drives her there and picks her up, I came home early because I wasn't feeling very well and went down to the basement to lie down. My dad was in there clearly watching porn and I was like OMG and he scrabbled around to turn it off. I left the room embarrassed and he came out and was angry at me saying that I should be helping my mum and then left the house to go there. I hadnt seen the screen fully but i noticed something absolutely black on the screen with the woman and I got a bad feeling. So I went on the computer and reopened the browser and the tabs were still open and it was all dogs having sex with women. I felt sick and I looked in his history and I found about 15-20 other records of porn in the last 3 months - 100% all of it was dogs having sex with women. All the timing was clearly when my mum is out at her stall.\n\nI think the bad feeling came from this... About 20 years ago when I was 13/14 my dad had some software program called 'Poser' which made 3D rendering of people. Once I came to talk to him while he was on the computer the screen is the opposite to the door but I saw something in the window that looked a dog having sex with a woman really fast as he minimized it. \n\nIt was windows XP with separate accounts his had a password but I saw him write it once and memorized it. I logged into his account and I found LOADS (seriously loads) of 3D rendered images of dogs having sex with women. I felt so sick, I was still a child. I deleted all the images and I uninstalled the program. I think this was my way of letting him know I knew and an attempt to make him stop. I told my sister (then 18F now 39F) about it cause I was really upset but that was it. \n\nThe next time I went on the computer my entire music collection had been deleted from my account as well as my downloading program had been uninstalled. I was pretty annoyed and I complained to my dad about it at dinner in front of my mum he got angry and was like WELL LOTS OF THINGS HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARING OFF THE COMPUTER RECENTLY HAVENT THEY?? I was so shocked by his reaction considering what his missing stuff was and I was a young girl it seemed audacious, I nearly said what is was to my mum but I was just too afraid.\n\nI decided to just leave it and try and try to forget about it. I told myself that at least it wasn't real porn with it in just these cgi cartoony things that don't have proper genitals. He changed his password and I never saw the new one.\n\nAfter catching him today and seeing all his porn choices in the history, I feel sick thinking he has been doing this this whole time since back then?\n\nI just don't know what to think or do. I don't know what to make of it. It doesn't seem like he wants to have sex with dogs himself but just see women with them. Is this a degradation thing? Is this messed up? Is he a secret pervert? Is this misogyny? Fetishism? \n\nI've been trying to look up help online but I only really seem to find stuff about people wanting/having sex with animals themselves - if he was into that would he not watch men have sex with dogs to imagine it is him? \n\nOther than this my dad is really great, he was an architect and is still an artist. He was a fun and warm and playful dad when I was young, he used to drive me to sports clubs all the time. He also warm and fun with my sisters kids now who love him the most out of everyone. I've never heard him say  anything thats made me think he is misogynistic or sexist. He is however very disorganized. My mother has always worked full time as well and she basically has to look after him to keep order. My mother is pretty emotional and can have bad mood swings and get shouty and she organises my dad but also has a go at him about it a lot and she is very dominating and can be belittling of others when she is mad.\n\nI thought when I was young maybe it was some sort of reaction to feeling demasculated (?) by my mum or something. I just wanted to forget cause aside from that I get on with him more than my mum and havent had issues with him, I also havent seen him angry like he was that day at dinner and even today it was unlike him to lash out at me about not helping my mum. \n\nI just don't know what to do. I think if my mum knew she would really go insane and probably chuck him out the house. I think she would be really hurt, it's messed my head up (although I saw it all) and I'm not married to him. They are in there 70s now and have been married nearly 50 years. \n\nI told my sister again and she said she thinks we should confront him but I just don't even know what to say. His previous reactions bother me also. She thinks we should try and get him to get help. She agreed she thinks my mum would be incredibly upset if she knew and it could be life ruining for her and thinks we should avoid telling her.\n\nI said maybe we could seek a professional therapist who specializes in this sort of thing and have a session and ask for advice from them on what to do before confronting him. But as I said I couldn't find anything I felt was appropriate so far, does anyone know of anyone/where for me to look for this issue?\n\nI'm also concerned because I know the possession of bestiality porn is illegal here in UK but I don't know about streaming it. He doesn't use a VPN or even an incognito window as I found the history in his browser. Could he get in trouble?\n\nI just feel physically sick and anxious about it. I wonder what else he might be doing.\n\nAm I over-reacting?\n\nPlease be gentle I've never actually posted on reddit before, I feel too embarrassed to ask friends for help. \n\nThanks in advance",

Robby's in his senior year of high school and he's honestly always been a good kid. I love that little brat.\n\nHowever, a few nights ago, I was in the middle of watching cobra kai while Brian was at work. I get a frantic call from Robby. I'll spare the details but he said that he had no money and was in emergency need of Plan B for his girlfriend (F18). He begged me not to tell his parents, and I agreed to it. It's worth noting that he doesn't have a car just yet, and apparently neither does his girlfriend. The kid was freaking out and screaming on the phone, so I took some time to calm him down and reassure him that his future was not ruined and everything was going to be okay.\n\nI went to the nearby CVS and even bought two Plan Bs in case this happens again in the future, and drove down to Robby. My sister and BIL were out for the night, and Robby couldn't thank me enough. I told him not to mention it and also advised him to stay careful in the future. Robby begged me to keep this between us, and I agreed to spare him embarrassment. Unfortunately, I got an angry call from Lisa the next morning, and she had found the other Plan B in Robby's bathroom drawer while she was cleaning the bathroom. She said it was out of line for me to go and do that behind her back, and that I should've told her and Harold. I said that Brian was freaking out and I didn't want to embarrass him or make him feel bad, but Lisa said I was an AH for interfering with her parenting, and that me \"advising him to stay careful in the future\" was an inappropriate thing to say to my own nephew. It's literally gotten to a point where Harold and even a couple of Lisa's friends have been messaging me. I haven't even told Brian about this to keep Robby's word. I wasn't judging him at all, I really was just trying to help.\n\nSince then, I've still been getting messages from Lisa, Harold, and their friends. I haven't responded to a single one, and I even posted to AITA about this before it got taken down. I got a lot of advice on giving Robby the talk, but I'm extremely worried about how inappropriate that's just going to look. But at the same time, I fear that Robby might be uneducated on this stuff, as Lisa and Harold have honestly always been weird about this. Where do I go from here?",

They said, \"we can dye it that color, no problem, no bleach will be used.\" After dyeing it, my hair came out two very different colors. Then they apply something in my hair. I ask what it is and, it's bleach. I express how much I didn't want that and that and how dare they just put it on my hair without telling me even after it was agreed that bleach wouldnt be used etc. They're like, \"oh you'll be fine\" and then proceeded to dye my hair a second time after the bleach. I look like a clown now with different colors on my hair (orange at the root and brownish red at the body).

I have curly hair so my curls will most likely not be the same also. \n\nI wanted a refund for this experience. These stylist did whatever they wanted to me.

(They are so clueless) I explain that I'm never coming back and leave with damaged hair, orange roots, and redish/brown hair, a lousy blowout, an uneven trim, and the delight of being shouted at by two extremely unprofessional ladies.

Yes, this is a serious question and not a troll even though it may sound like one. I know, it's weird. I've been addicted to masturbation, edging, and porn since I was 12 years old, and my addiction has never been worse than it is right now.\n\nTo break it all down for you, I typically edge to porn for around 10-12 hours a day, sleep for 4-6 hours a night, and then spend the remaining 6-8 hours of my day getting my priorities done (going to class, studying, and doing my homework). I'm still doing well in all of my college courses, and I enjoy learning and feeling successful by getting stellar grades. So at least that hasn't changed for me. \n\nBut besides that, I just masturbate for 10-12 hours a day and sleep for a little bit.

It's occured to me this could be part of an attempt to make it look like I commited suicide if I were to die suddenly. Am I being paranoid?\n\nI (26f) Have recently found reason to suggest my husband (29M) could be plotting to kill me and make it look like a suicide.\n\nYes, I realise how out there that sound, let me explain-\n\nMy reason for thinking is is because I discovered he has been secretly telling people we know, for a while, that I am apparently suicidal, along with other things to make me seem mentally unstable, as far as lying about having to call the police because I was a missing person. Recently the thought came to my mind, that this could be a way of making my death appear like a suicide, if he were to kill me, and I wanna share those thoughts to see what others think \n\nIt started after he one night told me not to go into the local store he works at, as he left early and had apparently used me as an excuse. Then not long after he happened to leave his messages open, and I noticed a conversation with his coworker about me, so curiosity got the better and I took a snoop. Turns out the excuse he'd used about me, was claiming that I'd gone missing and he needed to go look for me, adding the detail that I'm 'on suicide watch' even saying that he called the police. \n   \nOn another occasion, he said we can no longer go to his shop on Thursdays (It's the local store so we shop there regularly) because he'd told them he needed that day off as he takes me to therapy that day (This isn't true, we've never been to therapy)  \n\nMore recently we had similar incident, where he told me I couldn't go in the his shop as he'd used me as an excuse again. I Took another snoop and found he'd told them he needed to stay home with me due to my mental health. When he finally went back he told them that my brother is able to be with me now so he feels safe leaving me at home (I Haven't spoken to my brother in months)\n\nTo be clear, I have no history of mental health issues, never had to go to therapy, never been a missing person, nor has anyone ever had to call the police for me\n\nThis all also reminded me of a time a while ago, where he mentioned in casual conversation how he could get away with killing me, because no one would notice me missing. He explained how I don't talk to my friends or family regularly so they wouldn't realise I was gone, and he could just call my work and tell them I quit. This did creep me out at the time, but I brushed it off as a weird joke\n\nFor background, my husband is diagnosed with autism,  ADHD, and narcissistic personality disorder, he also has always had compulsive lying and anger issue. (I've Know of that since even before this) He also has a history of mistreating me, in a way some might call abusive. A lot of emotional abuse such as putting me down, both privately and in front of other,  being demanding and controling. He's never actually struck me physically, but has used threats of violence to get what he wants before\n\nAlthough all this concerns me, I also feel kinda silly for being concerned. Maybe I'm just paranoid, maybe I actually am as crazy as he's making me out to be? An outside perspective would be helpful.\n\nShould I do anything, or just ignore it and stop snooping?\n\nEDIT: Apologies for the way I've been replying to comments so far, I realise I've been acting kinda stubborn and it isn't helpful. I'm Gonna pause reading the comments for a bit so I can come back with a more clear head. Please do continue commenting if you have anything though as I will read them]",

Something where you get a chance to do an activity together. \n\n2. Go to Walmart (go with her) and pick out some arts and crafts supplies and draw pictures together. Even if you aren't good at art, doesn't matter, what matters is doing something together, maybe she takes your picture home and you keep hers. Or there are like craft kits for making little window/mirror decorations, just scrolling online there's like a paint your own unicorn, you could even give her a little sketchbook to draw in. Just stay away from things with small parts and beads and such. \n\n3. Does she have a designated place to sleep for her? Maybe you two can go pick out a blanket together that she keeps at your place, or stuffed animal, or pillow etc. Something that's hers for her sleeping spot to feel more comfortable. (sorry I'm thinking of a lot of purchasing ideas). \n\n4. Watch some movies together. Maybe some movies you liked as a kid if you have a streaming service that she hasn't seen before. Hell watch some star wars and make lightsabers out of cardboard boxes and such. \n\n5. If there's time when she visits and one near by, take her to the aquarium. They're excellent places. Also much better than the zoo. Maybe you go to the aquarium and afterwards you both draw your favorite fish that you saw while eating dinner? Or maybe you get her a little portable camera to take photos, or you let her take photos of the fish with your phone? \n\nProbably not the best ideas but hopefully inspire some other ones for you.

We get along well, but she tends to be reckless about many things and having to be saved by my grandfather.

The problem is that she has started an account on social media advertising herself as having that title which is illegal. She has already been told to not do it by my grandpa, but because he is so serious she has become very hostile and evasive with him.

But if you\u2019re asking strangers then you may either feel pressured (directly or indirectly) by your friends or you are slightly interested but nervous. It\u2019s not a hard drug - you won\u2019t get physically or mentally hooked after a couple of hits. But it can be habit forming and many people get sucked into it that way.\n\nWe\u2019ll speak only recreationally because medical is a whole other topic. First, I\u2019d personally recommend not smoking before 25. I\u2019m not sure how old you are but I have many friends who smoked in high school and \u2018claim\u2019 negative side effects like bad memory loss etc. it\u2019s better to wait for your brain to fully develop. \n\nIf you do want to try it, start small. Don\u2019t get pressured into doing more than your comfortable and give yourself some time to feel the effects before continuing. I usually find with smoking that 10-20 minutes after the hit I can feel it. Edibles are different and can take 30 minutes to 1.5+ hours.\n\nDifferent types of weed have different effects. You may not like what you smoke, but it could be the strain. You can always try another one later.\n\nYou may get paranoid. Just remember that it won\u2019t kill you and take deep breaths. Be close to people you trust who can help keep you relaxed. A good environment means a good high.\n\nWeed can be a good way to relax and hang out with friends - like drinking can - but it can also help distress from a long day. Do what feels right for you but if you find yourself smoking from morning until night, or you feel a compulsion to smoke before every meal, consider taking a break.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: updated age to 25 per many recommendations. Personally I started at 20 as many do in college but I\u2019m sure medically the recommendation is 25. If it\u2019s occasional and small amounts I don\u2019t think there\u2019s significant side effects.\n\nEdit 2: as always anyone who is neurodivergent or has a mental illness should always be cautious about using substances. If you see a therapist or psychiatrist and feel comfortable with them try to be honest about your usage. It\u2019ll help them help you and may impact what medications they recommend.",

At 7 years old she told me that our mother got pregnant with me as an accident so I was a mistake. At 12 years old, she stopped talking to me despite us living in the same home. So until I was 18 (when I had a chance to move out for school) my home life with her was a living hell. \n\nShe would throw out my dinner at times, leave me stranded out of the house for hours when I had forgotten my house keys, tell me I was worthless, humiliate me in front of my friends, mock me, call me obscene profanities, hide my things. She would judge every single action I would take and use it against me. She would reject and hate on me every single day. \nThe abuse got so bad that I spent every evening when I came home from school locked in my room just to avoid the abuse. \n\nMy parents knew she was mistreating me, and did nothing to stop it. If anything, they told me to just stay quiet, to avoid triggering her and to just ignore the abuse. I would ask them to do something about it but they just ignored my cries for help. \n\nEventually, after years of abuse I developed social anxiety and depression, and self esteem issues, all of which I\u2019m working to heal even to this day.\n\nFast forward to today. \nI live with my mother (71F) at the moment, and guess who came to visit last week for a week? My eldest sister.\n\nIt was hell again. She told me I was worthless again and started body-shaming me. Despite me standing up for myself, my mother kept telling me I should just stay quiet and not trigger her. \n\nSo when my sister left, I confronted my mother for continuing to enable these abusive dynamics, but she laughed it off saying I was being sensitive and that I should just move on.\nThat she didn\u2019t do anything about the abuse when I was younger because she was too busy working to feed\nand clothe us. That I should just be grateful because she loves me and had sacrificed so much for me.\n\nI don\u2019t think my sister will ever change as she is almost 50, and my mother doesn\u2019t take accountability for her role in enabling my sister\u2019s abuse. But it makes me so angry when she tells me that I am ungrateful daughter who should be more loving. \n\nMoving forward, what would be the best approach in dealing with my mother and sister?
