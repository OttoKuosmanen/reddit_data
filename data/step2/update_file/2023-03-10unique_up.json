I was out to everyone around me, bar my child, and I decided then that I would tell my child when old enough because other people were threatening to do it for me to try to embarrass me. It only would have embarrassed my child, like you are just now, if I hadn't prepared in advance.\n\nI laid the groundwork so that sex and sexuality, and women's choices were all discussed before I told my child. Then I told them slowly in an age appropriate way over the years.

He will use her ( & will have sex with her ) she is way to YOUNG to be with a man that old. **The ONLY reason he is with her is for sex** . Which she will give to him bc she is really stupid and thinks it is cool to be with him. She is really going to regret it when she is 18 ( or even younger ) as it will wreak her mind & ruin her life . As by that time she will be mentally a wreak from his emotional destruction of her . A grown man would NOT hang out with a young teen for anything  else .\n* This will **start her destruction of her mind** if she starts anything with him . He is a pedo. She is way out of her depth ( & **will NOT be able to stop him** doing what ever he wishes as well )  to her . She is a sitting duck to his abusive ways she is walking into a trap ( which will destroy her mind ) . As she is inexperienced immature , & a young teen that will be used by him & tossed aside .That will send her off the rails emotionally -> eg- she will get hypersexual ( could get prego or r\\*Ped then ) bc of her out of control behaviours . Leading often to drug / alcohol  & addictive behaviours to cope with the damage mentally this man will do to her ( or even his sicko friends  )  who he also might get to use her . For him to be chasing her he is already someone who doesn't care about her . ( abt her welfare & safety ) that means he is a real threat to her safety in every way . NOt just sexually. Predators have NO morals so won't care to not offer her up for the slaughter .\n* **Do NOT trust him around you either** . **DO NOT ever be alone with him** ( even with her )  She cannot help you at all ( she will be putty in his hands to manipulate , hurt & use ) . He could drug you both . And also attack you . He is a predator and could easily also be grooming her for others to also use. Or to drag in other gals for him & others to use for sex etc.\n* If she is a know it all ( **you will struggle to help her & stop her** ) you **can only try tell her of the real dangers that are real from him .** He is a pedo to be chasing her and **will be a risk to her safety in all ways .** A man has NO interest in a young teen except for sex. That is how young women go missing ( he could not just be a r\\*pist but also a sicko . And could get her sold off to anyone. She could also be nothing but a present  for him to sell to others also ( to make money off her ) . As mentioned if she thinks he cares she is very delusional  he will NOT in any way but to use her ( this is how so many young people get tricked into toxic volatile abusive relo's as teens are easy pray by predators who can easily twist , create , manipulate and pretend to them .  Young people are at high ***risk for trickery as they DO NOT have the mental capacity & skills present  to prevent it .*** ( even some adult women do not have it either ) so a young teen has ***NO hope of understanding the complexities around relo's & other people***  that will be used against her to trap her in a web of disgusting lies. They are nothing but putty in a groomers hands to be used very easily.\n* This man has his sights set on her for sex & grooming of her to be with him. He might just want sex ( but there is **NO way of knowing** if that is all he is after ) . As mentioned he might be setting her up for a big fall to be used & sold ( so he can make money off her ) . \n* If you want to save her tell on her ( tell parents if they care about her ) if not tell the police . She will hate you maybe , but it might just save her alot of heartache and pain as well & a mental disorder due to the mental anguish & abuse he will put her though .",

He was right he can\u2019t make me happy only I can make myself happy and only he can make himself happy. And only you can make your happy.

I don\u2019t even know how it really came up but I talked with her and called my bf \"he\".

He said that it\u2019s fine because (again) he goes by both he and they pronouns. T was basically just like \"whatever\" and was kinda rude to me the whole evening.

        "Question": "My son (13) is a sociopath and tried to kill his sister (6). I want him out of our lives, what can I do?\nThis account was made as a throwaway three or four months ago, when I feared my son was trying to hurt my family. He proceeded to set the house on fire with his sister, my sister and two family dogs in it. He has been an escalating issue for several years (I will post my old draft below in comment) and at this point he went to stay with his dad while my family, now homeless, took emergency shelter at a hotel. Because of the arson, a social worker came to my daughter at school to check on her safety at home. General bases to cover like access to food and clothing, and if she was harmed in any way. They met with me after this, to let me know that my daughter has been sexually abused by my son. She is 6 and he is 13. I broke down hearing what the worker quoted to me and I still am. My poor daughter had never told me. From the time I guess this may have happened (from context of the social worker\u2019s retelling; I don\u2019t want to pressure her or ask questions), I can deduce she may have been as little as 3 or 4. She knows that I know and I told her she did the right thing. I\u2019m doing my best to take care of her in this situation, asked the worker how to talk to her so she can feel safe, and filed the report and will file a restraining order.\n\nThe police are beginning to look to speak with my son. There is a reason this worries me. Ideally, they find him, and he gets arrested or sent to a facility. If he is given benefit, he will do or say anything to get what he wants. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do or say but I know nothing is off limits. The worker mentioned they\u2019d want to know if he was perpetuating abuse he was a victim of, so I have already prepared for the possibility that he accuses any family member, my boyfriend (my boyfriend has never been alone with either of them regardless of the fact that I trust him) or even myself of having abused him. I don\u2019t suspect he has been abused but to him, no casualty is too great to spare in order to get what he wants. Everything is a means to an end. We have endured suicide threats (that we took seriously), physical violence, running away, vandalism and now arson/attempted murder because he didn\u2019t get his way. \n\nI know I\u2019m supposed to still love him. I don\u2019t think I do. For the last year the house felt so tense when he was there. We were always on eggshells. Being away from him we feel like we finally have peace (with the exception of this news and him being involved in our lives again). All I want is to be done with him. I want to move forward with my daughter and never have him able to come near us or the possibility of him entering our lives. I know, big picture he needs to be away from people, guns and the internet and into serious therapy. Right now, I just want him out of our lives. How do I make sure this happens?",

I'm not rly sure if I grew up poor or if they just didnt give me anything because i slept on a bare mattress with no pillows sheets or blanket. i still have back problems from sitting on the floor all day on my computer since they didnt get me a chair or desk. i dont think I've ever been in love w anyone ever and I dont think ill ever b able to love someone. i dont think anyone will ever rly love me either. most of my family hates me most of my friends r fake. the only place I've ever felt real was on the internet but now this place is so dead theres no one to talk to ever. I try to tell people whats on my mind but no one ever responds. I honestly dont rly have any reason to stay in this town anymore. for months I've been thinking ab just disappearing one day and not coming back. I'm just so alone everyone I've ever cared ab is dead. all I want is someone who cares about me. I just want a fucking hug.

My only friends think I'm gross for having sex and a baby before marriage. I'm not even Christian anymore. The only people who want to talk to me are creepy dudes who want a one night stand or want to get with a vulnerable woman to harm me more. I like white guys, I need to point that out, but most of them are rude and give me unsolicited opinions about how they'd never date a black woman or how I should have used protection and they wouldn't raise a black man's baby when I didn't ask them to. I'm just looking for friends and get that BS the moment I they find out. My mom hates me and her solution is to find another man. I work overnights so my parents can babysit and my coworkers hate me too. The nicest ones don't even speak English.\n\nI live in Mankato, Minnesota. Not many black people here, and the ones that are here are mostly from Somalia, a Muslim country, and most of them don't speak much English. I met some Somalian people a few years ago, but a lady I used to talk to a lot now says I should get back with my abusive ex because raising a baby without him goes against God, and I'm gross for not being married before sex. That's probably most of their culture's opinions. I'm so tired of religion being used against me and racist white people making me feel like dirt. I should move, but I don't know where I can go where I'd be welcome. I'm not trying to get with another man. I just want friends so I don't go insane. I don't know what I can do around here when I work overnights, sleep in the afternoons, and don't know people to go to bars with. (Don't want to drink either because I'm nursing.)\n\nI think I'm on the autism spectrum and stumble over my words when I'm talking in person along with feeling like crap and always embarrassed like a spotlight is on me.\n\nThanks for any advice.

Up until recently we were not allowed any days off and if we were sick we were still expected to work as we could \u201cjust sit in the classroom and tell the children what to do\u201d. This kind of approach lead to 3 teachers leaving at once, resulting in me having to cover many new classes or even have 2 year levels in a class at once (which is difficult when they\u2019re on completely different curriculum/topics and need individual attention). \nA few weeks ago we hired more teachers so we could all have a lighter work load and be covered if someone was sick or needed a day off. The manager was the first one to take advantage of this and took a day off for a family birthday. So I also put in a request to have a day off as my partner is a professional athlete and will be playing in a very important final next week. I got the day approved and I worked out travel and accommodation for the match. That is until today, when she texted me to say that I can\u2019t have the day off anymore because she injured her foot  (a small cut with a couple of stitches) and is now on 2 weeks of sick leave, meaning I have to cover her classes. I didn\u2019t reply because I was extremely frustrated and didn\u2019t know how to respond so I went to the gym to blow off some steam. When I arrived at the gym I saw said manager working out on the treadmill and stair master. We didn\u2019t acknowledge each other. Now I don\u2019t know how to respond.

        "Question": "A child I\u2019m babysitting has very large bruises\nHi guys, I\u2019m new to this sub but I don\u2019t know what to do. I [18F] am currently watching two siblings (both under the age of 4), the oldest is still napping, but the youngest is a little girl and I just changed her diaper. When I went to wipe her, I saw a green and purple bruise spread across her entire bottom. It\u2019s very large. Could this be from spanking? I babysit for their best friends every other week as well, should I mention this to them? This is the first time I\u2019m sitting for them, the mom seemed very anxious but I just chalked it up to me being their first sitter ever. I was abused as a child but being in the situation of the grown up, I don\u2019t know what to do. Please help me. Do I take pictures of the bruise? What if nobody believes me without proof? Is that wrong?? I\u2019m going to check the oldest\u2019s bottom once he wakes up while I\u2019m changing him and see if there\u2019s something similar.\n\nUPDATE: The oldest\u2019s entire bottom and legs are bruised too. I have been able to take pictures of JUST their backs and the backs of the oldest\u2019s legs, as they have bruises all the way up their spines as well. Nothing from the photo could be taken as pornographic. I have looked at Mongolian Spots and didn\u2019t know about them prior to this issue, so thank you for those that have educated me. I did call the parents friends who I am very close with and trust, and they said they will help me out. I doubt that it\u2019s those though, they both have the same marks in the exact same spots and they\u2019re purple and look like bruises. I can see blood vessels. I\u2019ll keep y\u2019all updated.

Fast forward 17 years, I'm 28 now and my sister has two children of her own. Up until now, there's been no evidence of her abusing my nieces but my mom called me today and told me that the older of the two girls (10) was slammed up against a wall by my sister for \"mouthing off.\" For years, I've put off calling my sister in because it seemed that she was too scared of losing her social position to abuse the girls and that maybe she viewed her girls fundamentally different from me, and I figured that was at least better then a foster home. But now, I don't know what to do. I'm terrified for both of my nieces and feel deeply guilty that I haven't done anything until now, and feel like this has been going on for MUCH longer then we know if my sister was comfortable with casually bringing it up to my mom.",

He's an all around asshole, and I just hate him. About a year ago he was fishing on a boat, and it sank, 1 person who was onboard died, and ever since he's been a little more fucked than usual. He's done nothing but drink and get mad and yell ever since. Sure he did all of that stuff before on a weekly basis, but ever since it's been on about a daily basis. So for about a year he just didn't work whatsoever because he's been scared to go back on a boat, but since we're broke as shit he finally went back on the water for a week last week. Apparently they tormented him on the boat and kept playing tricks about the boat going down to fuck with him, so he came home and went on a 3 day bender, yelling and breaking shit for 3 days straight. My mom also happens to be pretty sick, and she's having lots of lung related problems,and she has to go in tomorrow overnight. And he wants me to stay tomorrow to keep him company. Now the thing is, I know if I stay, I'm probably not going to leave my room once so I don't see what difference it makes. On top of that I've already missed a lot of school recently, and while he was on his bender I didn't leave my room for 3 days, so I haven't eaten in 3 days, because I obviously didn't want to go out and deal with him screaming and breaking shit, so for that reason alone I think he deserves to be alone for a day.

        "Question": "My (50F) son (15M) has become a far-right extremist and I have no idea what to do\n \n\nThrowaway account because this is too embarrassing.\n\nFor some context, my son is on the spectrum and has difficulty forming relationships with people as a result, although he still has a few in person friends. He's extremely intelligent, and knows many things, especially when he puts his mind to it. I also know he uses a lot of social media, since it's easier for him to make friends that way, however I did not monitor them which I regret doing.\n\nThe first red flag was when he was 13 and he began talking to me about various statistics which he said proved that the races were not equal, like crime and IQ, and when I pointed out there are societal reasons for this, he went on a rant and said that that these are actually biological (I still don't know what his sources are). At that time I just chalked it up to him not understanding the world very well and assumed he would grow out of it, but it has only gotten worse in every way.\n\nHe ordered a copy of Mein Kampf to our home. Fortunately, I saw the package and threw it away before he could get his hands on it, but when I confronted him about it, he started screaming and telling me that all his online friends and he started a reading group where they would read books together and they started with Mein Kampf, and that now he would be left out. I asked him if any of his friends at school were reading Mein Kampf, and he said that they were \"normies\" who didn't understand reality. I asked him if he thought I was a \"normie\" too, and he went on an incredibly misogynistic tirade against me saying that I was a \"whore\" and a \"roastie\" (I looked up what it meant later and I was horrified) for pursuing my career (which has provided our family with lots of money, including that he benefits from!) and for openly talking about my past relationships before I met his father, and also because his father and were never married and now separated. He told me he hated me for ruining his life by waiting \"so long\" to have children which is why he was on the spectrum and had difficulty talking to people (many of my friends had children at my age and they did not have children on the spectrum, not that it's a problem anyway). And that was only the beginning, I do not wish to go into more detail, but I couldn't even say anything to him as I broke down crying. I loved my son and we were so close until that point and never before had anything so mean ever been said to me. I couldn't handle it. I didn't understand why he would say such horrible things to me, or how he could have learned such ideas. I am a progressive, and especially feminist, and I thought I was raising our son to hold the same values, but he became the complete opposite of what I wanted him to be.\n\nIn the aftermath of this, I confiscated his computer and phone, although I did let him send one last message to his horrible \"friends\" since he wouldn't stop screaming to us about how he couldn't just abandon them without saying anything. However, this did not help in any way. He began spending more and more time outside the house, which I thought was a good thing and that maybe he was socializing with his peers who didn't accept this sort of thing. I also noticed over the next few months that he was getting more and more muscular, I was proud of him, but I also did not want him to believe he had to prove his \"manliness\" by getting big muscles, he then cursed me out and told me I was trying to make him a \"soyboy\" (a term I did not know and had to look up) so he didn't care what I had to say. Eventually I find out he somehow managed to find a skinhead gang after school and they workout together... after I saw him with them, I screamed at him and then at them that they as grown men should stop trying to manipulate a teenage boy and there was no reason for him to spend time with strange men in their 20s and 30s.\n\nAfter that, I was very strict about everything he was doing. I would pick him up and drop him off, even though it meant I needed to take off time from work to do so. When I dropped him off at home, I locked the doors to make sure he could not escape before returning to work. However, this did not work either, and eventually I was called by the school principle who let us know that he and his school friends (who he has also convinced to become Nazis now!) had beaten a group of POC boys up and that he and his friends would receive a suspension as a result. I was so livid. I could not imagine the fact I was raising a future criminal, and he told me that I was a traitor for not being proud of him for being stronger than them and for beating up \"murderers of our people, rapists of our women, and invaders of our lands\". No reason can get to him, and no discipline can get to him. And now I AM SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES TOO, all my friends now assume I must be a racist because of my son, and don't want to spend time with me anymore. The other parents at the school avoid me. People who used to be friendly are now cold. I have no idea how to deal with this situation, can anyone here on Reddit give me good advice?",

Dad sleeps on the nastiest couch with the dogs (we adopted before mom passed). I want to completely tear down the house and build a new one.

I try to let him get his temper out but then he will say something like I never want your dad at the house again. If you want to see him it can\u2019t be on my property.

I had 4-6 months left or try this experimental procedure which could be deadly. \n\nMy family and friends were completely sympathetic but I alone had to deal with my decision either way. \n\nI decided to do the experimental procedure. I was scared shitless and consistently depressed. I was heavily medicated for anxiety and panic attacks. I couldn\u2019t get out of my own head for a long time. Fortunately I\u2019ve been in remission for 2 years. The other person who had the procedure and lived has now died. I don\u2019t know how long I have months to 20+ years. I\u2019ve been where you are and I could be again. It\u2019s all a mystery. \n\nPlease don\u2019t give up and find just one person, even another terminal patient, to talk with. Having a horrible situation in common can be cathartic. \n\nPlease feel free to message me if you would like to talk. I\u2019m sending you healing and peaceful vibes.",

        "Question": "Is it worth reporting to the police that someone has accessed my back sunroom and killed (stabbed) my 2 pet birds?\nI have, or had now, 2 small pet birds. A budgie/parakeet and a canary. They both live in separate cages. Their cages are kept in a back sunroom. It seems I forgot to lock the outside access door when I went out (have had lots on my mind recently). When home I found they had been stabbed, cut up, inside their cages, blood and feathers. No valuables are kept in this room and I'm unsure if anything is missing. This is quite disturbing.\n\nThey are only small birds but were pets. I know it's not like having a cat or dog killed but I had trained these little guys to hand feed, use swings and the budgie had started to talk a couple of words. The canary was currently nesting with 4 eggs (infertile). \n\nI don't want to have the police laugh at me or be accused of wasting their time. Do you think they would take this seriously? I will be looking up about animal cruelty laws and attacks on pets etc anyway.\n\nWhat kind of sick person would kill a small animal inside a cage?\n\n\nThis might sound weird but over the weekend late at night someone tried to break down my front door. From the voices it was at least a couple of guys. They were calling out the name of an ex-friend. I'm in the process of getting a restraining order on that former friend as I believe they were involved somehow. I'm assuming the bird deaths are probably/obviously related to that somehow.\nUnsure now to add the birds onto that order too. Or just make a new separate report to the police. Or just try move on. As upsetting as this is I already have enough things currently to deal with in my life.\n\nJust thought some advice might help. My head hurts at the moment to think straight really.",

        "Question": "I just want my name change to be respected.\nI\u2019m going to try to make all of this simple to you guys since it\u2019s rocket-science to my family that I wanted a feminine name and gave it to myself. I just wanted to feel satisfied. \n\nI was born with a name that I did not like, so I changed it last year when I was 19. I\u2019m 20 now and my family still can\u2019t get with the program. I changed my name because I always hated it. My mom named me something so masculine. Before you guys get on me, I\u2019m aware that gender neutral names exist but this wasn\u2019t that. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cJordan\u201d or \u201cAlex\u201d situation. She named me after a famous male actor because she thought he was sexy and she\u2019d never heard of a girl with his name before. She said I was going to be named that no matter if I was a boy or girl. Then, to make shit even worse, she gave me a feminine middle name. I\u2019d been getting comments and questions about my name since I was in elementary school and I was seven years old telling myself that I\u2019d change my name because I was just so tired. I just wanted to not be embarrassed. \n\nThe last straw that lead me to change my name was when I was at work and a guy asked me my name. I told him and he raised a brow and asked \u201cLike the actor?\u201d and I told him yes. Then, he proceeded to say \u201cWell, you\u2019re still beautiful anyway\u201d and left. That was when I started the process of legally filing to change my name. \n\nWhen the name change did finalize and happen, my mom just couldn\u2019t understand my choice. She compared it to how transgender people change their gender (I couldn\u2019t get a grip on her comparison) and she compared my name to her name, saying she\u2019d been teased all her life but her name is very much just feminine and Biblical. People know she\u2019s a woman before they see her face but I had people thinking I was a guy before they ever even saw me because my name was so masculine.  She said I should\u2019ve took that as a good thing and used every excuse in the book to avoid understanding my perspective. She even said it was disrespectful. Disrespectful for me to want a girly name so that I can live within my girly self? Disrespectful for me to not want to feel bad when people made unnecessary comments and said that my birth name was a \u201cboy name\u201d? \n\nRegardless of me changing my name, my family still continues to call me by my old name. I\u2019ve tried to reenforce it but they just won\u2019t listen. However, they always expect me to respect them but deliberately choose to ignore my wishes. Only a FEW people in my family try to respect my name change and best believe I can only count on one hand. I\u2019ve received better support from friends. My dad told me on the phone that he would still call me by my birth name but he still mixes it up and calls me by both names. My big sister says she\u2019s not calling me by my new name because she\u2019s not used to it and I don\u2019t look like the name that I\u2019ve picked. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019ve done this for no reason. \n\nI\u2019m going to the military sometime this year and I\u2019ve made it a goal to get this respect thing situated. I\u2019m old enough to receive the same respect the adults in my family expect from me so if they\u2019re still doing this to me when I join, I\u2019m cutting them off. I even told myself that they\u2019d be banned from my wedding if I get married and even the birth of my children if I have any if they can\u2019t respect my choice. My wedding invites and baby shower invites would say my new name and I don\u2019t need any confusion or embarrassment when my family meets my future husband\u2019s family. The way my family is acting, they\u2019re going to miss out on all that stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s not THAT hard to call someone what they want to be called and I don\u2019t know what I can do to change them from being ignorant.\n\nEDIT: Why would my mom throw trans people in the mix when if I did want to be trans, I\u2019d have to take one less step considering the fact that my name literally used to be masculine? She set me up with a masculine name anyway so I wouldn\u2019t have had to change my name if I wanted to be a male. It makes no sense. Give a girl a masculine name and then get mad at her for wanting a feminine name instead? Am I wrong?",
