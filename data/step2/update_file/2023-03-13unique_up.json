I was out to everyone around me, bar my child, and I decided then that I would tell my child when old enough because other people were threatening to do it for me to try to embarrass me. It only would have embarrassed my child, like you are just now, if I hadn't prepared in advance.\n\nI laid the groundwork so that sex and sexuality, and women's choices were all discussed before I told my child. Then I told them slowly in an age appropriate way over the years.

He will use her ( & will have sex with her ) she is way to YOUNG to be with a man that old. **The ONLY reason he is with her is for sex** . Which she will give to him bc she is really stupid and thinks it is cool to be with him. She is really going to regret it when she is 18 ( or even younger ) as it will wreak her mind & ruin her life . As by that time she will be mentally a wreak from his emotional destruction of her . A grown man would NOT hang out with a young teen for anything  else .\n* This will **start her destruction of her mind** if she starts anything with him . He is a pedo. She is way out of her depth ( & **will NOT be able to stop him** doing what ever he wishes as well )  to her . She is a sitting duck to his abusive ways she is walking into a trap ( which will destroy her mind ) . As she is inexperienced immature , & a young teen that will be used by him & tossed aside .That will send her off the rails emotionally -> eg- she will get hypersexual ( could get prego or r\\*Ped then ) bc of her out of control behaviours . Leading often to drug / alcohol  & addictive behaviours to cope with the damage mentally this man will do to her ( or even his sicko friends  )  who he also might get to use her . For him to be chasing her he is already someone who doesn't care about her . ( abt her welfare & safety ) that means he is a real threat to her safety in every way . NOt just sexually. Predators have NO morals so won't care to not offer her up for the slaughter .\n* **Do NOT trust him around you either** . **DO NOT ever be alone with him** ( even with her )  She cannot help you at all ( she will be putty in his hands to manipulate , hurt & use ) . He could drug you both . And also attack you . He is a predator and could easily also be grooming her for others to also use. Or to drag in other gals for him & others to use for sex etc.\n* If she is a know it all ( **you will struggle to help her & stop her** ) you **can only try tell her of the real dangers that are real from him .** He is a pedo to be chasing her and **will be a risk to her safety in all ways .** A man has NO interest in a young teen except for sex. That is how young women go missing ( he could not just be a r\\*pist but also a sicko . And could get her sold off to anyone. She could also be nothing but a present  for him to sell to others also ( to make money off her ) . As mentioned if she thinks he cares she is very delusional  he will NOT in any way but to use her ( this is how so many young people get tricked into toxic volatile abusive relo's as teens are easy pray by predators who can easily twist , create , manipulate and pretend to them .  Young people are at high ***risk for trickery as they DO NOT have the mental capacity & skills present  to prevent it .*** ( even some adult women do not have it either ) so a young teen has ***NO hope of understanding the complexities around relo's & other people***  that will be used against her to trap her in a web of disgusting lies. They are nothing but putty in a groomers hands to be used very easily.\n* This man has his sights set on her for sex & grooming of her to be with him. He might just want sex ( but there is **NO way of knowing** if that is all he is after ) . As mentioned he might be setting her up for a big fall to be used & sold ( so he can make money off her ) . \n* If you want to save her tell on her ( tell parents if they care about her ) if not tell the police . She will hate you maybe , but it might just save her alot of heartache and pain as well & a mental disorder due to the mental anguish & abuse he will put her though .",

He was right he can\u2019t make me happy only I can make myself happy and only he can make himself happy. And only you can make your happy.

I don\u2019t even know how it really came up but I talked with her and called my bf \"he\".

He said that it\u2019s fine because (again) he goes by both he and they pronouns. T was basically just like \"whatever\" and was kinda rude to me the whole evening.

        "Question": "My son (13) is a sociopath and tried to kill his sister (6). I want him out of our lives, what can I do?\nThis account was made as a throwaway three or four months ago, when I feared my son was trying to hurt my family. He proceeded to set the house on fire with his sister, my sister and two family dogs in it. He has been an escalating issue for several years (I will post my old draft below in comment) and at this point he went to stay with his dad while my family, now homeless, took emergency shelter at a hotel. Because of the arson, a social worker came to my daughter at school to check on her safety at home. General bases to cover like access to food and clothing, and if she was harmed in any way. They met with me after this, to let me know that my daughter has been sexually abused by my son. She is 6 and he is 13. I broke down hearing what the worker quoted to me and I still am. My poor daughter had never told me. From the time I guess this may have happened (from context of the social worker\u2019s retelling; I don\u2019t want to pressure her or ask questions), I can deduce she may have been as little as 3 or 4. She knows that I know and I told her she did the right thing. I\u2019m doing my best to take care of her in this situation, asked the worker how to talk to her so she can feel safe, and filed the report and will file a restraining order.\n\nThe police are beginning to look to speak with my son. There is a reason this worries me. Ideally, they find him, and he gets arrested or sent to a facility. If he is given benefit, he will do or say anything to get what he wants. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do or say but I know nothing is off limits. The worker mentioned they\u2019d want to know if he was perpetuating abuse he was a victim of, so I have already prepared for the possibility that he accuses any family member, my boyfriend (my boyfriend has never been alone with either of them regardless of the fact that I trust him) or even myself of having abused him. I don\u2019t suspect he has been abused but to him, no casualty is too great to spare in order to get what he wants. Everything is a means to an end. We have endured suicide threats (that we took seriously), physical violence, running away, vandalism and now arson/attempted murder because he didn\u2019t get his way. \n\nI know I\u2019m supposed to still love him. I don\u2019t think I do. For the last year the house felt so tense when he was there. We were always on eggshells. Being away from him we feel like we finally have peace (with the exception of this news and him being involved in our lives again). All I want is to be done with him. I want to move forward with my daughter and never have him able to come near us or the possibility of him entering our lives. I know, big picture he needs to be away from people, guns and the internet and into serious therapy. Right now, I just want him out of our lives. How do I make sure this happens?",

I'm not rly sure if I grew up poor or if they just didnt give me anything because i slept on a bare mattress with no pillows sheets or blanket. i still have back problems from sitting on the floor all day on my computer since they didnt get me a chair or desk. i dont think I've ever been in love w anyone ever and I dont think ill ever b able to love someone. i dont think anyone will ever rly love me either. most of my family hates me most of my friends r fake. the only place I've ever felt real was on the internet but now this place is so dead theres no one to talk to ever. I try to tell people whats on my mind but no one ever responds. I honestly dont rly have any reason to stay in this town anymore. for months I've been thinking ab just disappearing one day and not coming back. I'm just so alone everyone I've ever cared ab is dead. all I want is someone who cares about me. I just want a fucking hug.

My only friends think I'm gross for having sex and a baby before marriage. I'm not even Christian anymore. The only people who want to talk to me are creepy dudes who want a one night stand or want to get with a vulnerable woman to harm me more. I like white guys, I need to point that out, but most of them are rude and give me unsolicited opinions about how they'd never date a black woman or how I should have used protection and they wouldn't raise a black man's baby when I didn't ask them to. I'm just looking for friends and get that BS the moment I they find out. My mom hates me and her solution is to find another man. I work overnights so my parents can babysit and my coworkers hate me too. The nicest ones don't even speak English.\n\nI live in Mankato, Minnesota. Not many black people here, and the ones that are here are mostly from Somalia, a Muslim country, and most of them don't speak much English. I met some Somalian people a few years ago, but a lady I used to talk to a lot now says I should get back with my abusive ex because raising a baby without him goes against God, and I'm gross for not being married before sex. That's probably most of their culture's opinions. I'm so tired of religion being used against me and racist white people making me feel like dirt. I should move, but I don't know where I can go where I'd be welcome. I'm not trying to get with another man. I just want friends so I don't go insane. I don't know what I can do around here when I work overnights, sleep in the afternoons, and don't know people to go to bars with. (Don't want to drink either because I'm nursing.)\n\nI think I'm on the autism spectrum and stumble over my words when I'm talking in person along with feeling like crap and always embarrassed like a spotlight is on me.\n\nThanks for any advice.

Up until recently we were not allowed any days off and if we were sick we were still expected to work as we could \u201cjust sit in the classroom and tell the children what to do\u201d. This kind of approach lead to 3 teachers leaving at once, resulting in me having to cover many new classes or even have 2 year levels in a class at once (which is difficult when they\u2019re on completely different curriculum/topics and need individual attention). \nA few weeks ago we hired more teachers so we could all have a lighter work load and be covered if someone was sick or needed a day off. The manager was the first one to take advantage of this and took a day off for a family birthday. So I also put in a request to have a day off as my partner is a professional athlete and will be playing in a very important final next week. I got the day approved and I worked out travel and accommodation for the match. That is until today, when she texted me to say that I can\u2019t have the day off anymore because she injured her foot  (a small cut with a couple of stitches) and is now on 2 weeks of sick leave, meaning I have to cover her classes. I didn\u2019t reply because I was extremely frustrated and didn\u2019t know how to respond so I went to the gym to blow off some steam. When I arrived at the gym I saw said manager working out on the treadmill and stair master. We didn\u2019t acknowledge each other. Now I don\u2019t know how to respond.

        "Question": "A child I\u2019m babysitting has very large bruises\nHi guys, I\u2019m new to this sub but I don\u2019t know what to do. I [18F] am currently watching two siblings (both under the age of 4), the oldest is still napping, but the youngest is a little girl and I just changed her diaper. When I went to wipe her, I saw a green and purple bruise spread across her entire bottom. It\u2019s very large. Could this be from spanking? I babysit for their best friends every other week as well, should I mention this to them? This is the first time I\u2019m sitting for them, the mom seemed very anxious but I just chalked it up to me being their first sitter ever. I was abused as a child but being in the situation of the grown up, I don\u2019t know what to do. Please help me. Do I take pictures of the bruise? What if nobody believes me without proof? Is that wrong?? I\u2019m going to check the oldest\u2019s bottom once he wakes up while I\u2019m changing him and see if there\u2019s something similar.\n\nUPDATE: The oldest\u2019s entire bottom and legs are bruised too. I have been able to take pictures of JUST their backs and the backs of the oldest\u2019s legs, as they have bruises all the way up their spines as well. Nothing from the photo could be taken as pornographic. I have looked at Mongolian Spots and didn\u2019t know about them prior to this issue, so thank you for those that have educated me. I did call the parents friends who I am very close with and trust, and they said they will help me out. I doubt that it\u2019s those though, they both have the same marks in the exact same spots and they\u2019re purple and look like bruises. I can see blood vessels. I\u2019ll keep y\u2019all updated.

Up until now, there's been no evidence of her abusing my nieces but my mom called me today and told me that the older of the two girls (10) was slammed up against a wall by my sister for \"mouthing off.\" For years, I've put off calling my sister in because it seemed that she was too scared of losing her social position to abuse the girls and that maybe she viewed her girls fundamentally different from me, and I figured that was at least better then a foster home. But now, I don't know what to do.

He's an all around asshole, and I just hate him. About a year ago he was fishing on a boat, and it sank, 1 person who was onboard died, and ever since he's been a little more fucked than usual. He's done nothing but drink and get mad and yell ever since. Sure he did all of that stuff before on a weekly basis, but ever since it's been on about a daily basis. So for about a year he just didn't work whatsoever because he's been scared to go back on a boat, but since we're broke as shit he finally went back on the water for a week last week. Apparently they tormented him on the boat and kept playing tricks about the boat going down to fuck with him, so he came home and went on a 3 day bender, yelling and breaking shit for 3 days straight. My mom also happens to be pretty sick, and she's having lots of lung related problems,and she has to go in tomorrow overnight. And he wants me to stay tomorrow to keep him company. Now the thing is, I know if I stay, I'm probably not going to leave my room once so I don't see what difference it makes. On top of that I've already missed a lot of school recently, and while he was on his bender I didn't leave my room for 3 days, so I haven't eaten in 3 days, because I obviously didn't want to go out and deal with him screaming and breaking shit, so for that reason alone I think he deserves to be alone for a day.

        "Question": "My (50F) son (15M) has become a far-right extremist and I have no idea what to do\n \n\nThrowaway account because this is too embarrassing.\n\nFor some context, my son is on the spectrum and has difficulty forming relationships with people as a result, although he still has a few in person friends. He's extremely intelligent, and knows many things, especially when he puts his mind to it. I also know he uses a lot of social media, since it's easier for him to make friends that way, however I did not monitor them which I regret doing.\n\nThe first red flag was when he was 13 and he began talking to me about various statistics which he said proved that the races were not equal, like crime and IQ, and when I pointed out there are societal reasons for this, he went on a rant and said that that these are actually biological (I still don't know what his sources are). At that time I just chalked it up to him not understanding the world very well and assumed he would grow out of it, but it has only gotten worse in every way.\n\nHe ordered a copy of Mein Kampf to our home. Fortunately, I saw the package and threw it away before he could get his hands on it, but when I confronted him about it, he started screaming and telling me that all his online friends and he started a reading group where they would read books together and they started with Mein Kampf, and that now he would be left out. I asked him if any of his friends at school were reading Mein Kampf, and he said that they were \"normies\" who didn't understand reality. I asked him if he thought I was a \"normie\" too, and he went on an incredibly misogynistic tirade against me saying that I was a \"whore\" and a \"roastie\" (I looked up what it meant later and I was horrified) for pursuing my career (which has provided our family with lots of money, including that he benefits from!) and for openly talking about my past relationships before I met his father, and also because his father and were never married and now separated. He told me he hated me for ruining his life by waiting \"so long\" to have children which is why he was on the spectrum and had difficulty talking to people (many of my friends had children at my age and they did not have children on the spectrum, not that it's a problem anyway). And that was only the beginning, I do not wish to go into more detail, but I couldn't even say anything to him as I broke down crying. I loved my son and we were so close until that point and never before had anything so mean ever been said to me. I couldn't handle it. I didn't understand why he would say such horrible things to me, or how he could have learned such ideas. I am a progressive, and especially feminist, and I thought I was raising our son to hold the same values, but he became the complete opposite of what I wanted him to be.\n\nIn the aftermath of this, I confiscated his computer and phone, although I did let him send one last message to his horrible \"friends\" since he wouldn't stop screaming to us about how he couldn't just abandon them without saying anything. However, this did not help in any way. He began spending more and more time outside the house, which I thought was a good thing and that maybe he was socializing with his peers who didn't accept this sort of thing. I also noticed over the next few months that he was getting more and more muscular, I was proud of him, but I also did not want him to believe he had to prove his \"manliness\" by getting big muscles, he then cursed me out and told me I was trying to make him a \"soyboy\" (a term I did not know and had to look up) so he didn't care what I had to say. Eventually I find out he somehow managed to find a skinhead gang after school and they workout together... after I saw him with them, I screamed at him and then at them that they as grown men should stop trying to manipulate a teenage boy and there was no reason for him to spend time with strange men in their 20s and 30s.\n\nAfter that, I was very strict about everything he was doing. I would pick him up and drop him off, even though it meant I needed to take off time from work to do so. When I dropped him off at home, I locked the doors to make sure he could not escape before returning to work. However, this did not work either, and eventually I was called by the school principle who let us know that he and his school friends (who he has also convinced to become Nazis now!) had beaten a group of POC boys up and that he and his friends would receive a suspension as a result. I was so livid. I could not imagine the fact I was raising a future criminal, and he told me that I was a traitor for not being proud of him for being stronger than them and for beating up \"murderers of our people, rapists of our women, and invaders of our lands\". No reason can get to him, and no discipline can get to him. And now I AM SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES TOO, all my friends now assume I must be a racist because of my son, and don't want to spend time with me anymore. The other parents at the school avoid me. People who used to be friendly are now cold. I have no idea how to deal with this situation, can anyone here on Reddit give me good advice?",

Dad sleeps on the nastiest couch with the dogs (we adopted before mom passed). I want to completely tear down the house and build a new one.

        "Question": "Is it worth reporting to the police that someone has accessed my back sunroom and killed (stabbed) my 2 pet birds?\nI have, or had now, 2 small pet birds. A budgie/parakeet and a canary. They both live in separate cages. Their cages are kept in a back sunroom. It seems I forgot to lock the outside access door when I went out (have had lots on my mind recently). When home I found they had been stabbed, cut up, inside their cages, blood and feathers. No valuables are kept in this room and I'm unsure if anything is missing. This is quite disturbing.\n\nThey are only small birds but were pets. I know it's not like having a cat or dog killed but I had trained these little guys to hand feed, use swings and the budgie had started to talk a couple of words. The canary was currently nesting with 4 eggs (infertile). \n\nI don't want to have the police laugh at me or be accused of wasting their time. Do you think they would take this seriously? I will be looking up about animal cruelty laws and attacks on pets etc anyway.\n\nWhat kind of sick person would kill a small animal inside a cage?\n\n\nThis might sound weird but over the weekend late at night someone tried to break down my front door. From the voices it was at least a couple of guys. They were calling out the name of an ex-friend. I'm in the process of getting a restraining order on that former friend as I believe they were involved somehow. I'm assuming the bird deaths are probably/obviously related to that somehow.\nUnsure now to add the birds onto that order too. Or just make a new separate report to the police. Or just try move on. As upsetting as this is I already have enough things currently to deal with in my life.\n\nJust thought some advice might help. My head hurts at the moment to think straight really.",

        "Question": "I just want my name change to be respected.\nI\u2019m going to try to make all of this simple to you guys since it\u2019s rocket-science to my family that I wanted a feminine name and gave it to myself. I just wanted to feel satisfied. \n\nI was born with a name that I did not like, so I changed it last year when I was 19. I\u2019m 20 now and my family still can\u2019t get with the program. I changed my name because I always hated it. My mom named me something so masculine. Before you guys get on me, I\u2019m aware that gender neutral names exist but this wasn\u2019t that. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cJordan\u201d or \u201cAlex\u201d situation. She named me after a famous male actor because she thought he was sexy and she\u2019d never heard of a girl with his name before. She said I was going to be named that no matter if I was a boy or girl. Then, to make shit even worse, she gave me a feminine middle name. I\u2019d been getting comments and questions about my name since I was in elementary school and I was seven years old telling myself that I\u2019d change my name because I was just so tired. I just wanted to not be embarrassed. \n\nThe last straw that lead me to change my name was when I was at work and a guy asked me my name. I told him and he raised a brow and asked \u201cLike the actor?\u201d and I told him yes. Then, he proceeded to say \u201cWell, you\u2019re still beautiful anyway\u201d and left. That was when I started the process of legally filing to change my name. \n\nWhen the name change did finalize and happen, my mom just couldn\u2019t understand my choice. She compared it to how transgender people change their gender (I couldn\u2019t get a grip on her comparison) and she compared my name to her name, saying she\u2019d been teased all her life but her name is very much just feminine and Biblical. People know she\u2019s a woman before they see her face but I had people thinking I was a guy before they ever even saw me because my name was so masculine.  She said I should\u2019ve took that as a good thing and used every excuse in the book to avoid understanding my perspective. She even said it was disrespectful. Disrespectful for me to want a girly name so that I can live within my girly self? Disrespectful for me to not want to feel bad when people made unnecessary comments and said that my birth name was a \u201cboy name\u201d? \n\nRegardless of me changing my name, my family still continues to call me by my old name. I\u2019ve tried to reenforce it but they just won\u2019t listen. However, they always expect me to respect them but deliberately choose to ignore my wishes. Only a FEW people in my family try to respect my name change and best believe I can only count on one hand. I\u2019ve received better support from friends. My dad told me on the phone that he would still call me by my birth name but he still mixes it up and calls me by both names. My big sister says she\u2019s not calling me by my new name because she\u2019s not used to it and I don\u2019t look like the name that I\u2019ve picked. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019ve done this for no reason. \n\nI\u2019m going to the military sometime this year and I\u2019ve made it a goal to get this respect thing situated. I\u2019m old enough to receive the same respect the adults in my family expect from me so if they\u2019re still doing this to me when I join, I\u2019m cutting them off. I even told myself that they\u2019d be banned from my wedding if I get married and even the birth of my children if I have any if they can\u2019t respect my choice. My wedding invites and baby shower invites would say my new name and I don\u2019t need any confusion or embarrassment when my family meets my future husband\u2019s family. The way my family is acting, they\u2019re going to miss out on all that stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s not THAT hard to call someone what they want to be called and I don\u2019t know what I can do to change them from being ignorant.\n\nEDIT: Why would my mom throw trans people in the mix when if I did want to be trans, I\u2019d have to take one less step considering the fact that my name literally used to be masculine? She set me up with a masculine name anyway so I wouldn\u2019t have had to change my name if I wanted to be a male. It makes no sense. Give a girl a masculine name and then get mad at her for wanting a feminine name instead? Am I wrong?",

        "Question": "Was I groomed by my teacher at 15? My therapist says I was. I\u2019m now 24 and the teacher is suddenly emailing me.\nThis is my first time using Reddit, so apologies in advance if i\u2019m doing anything incorrectly and sorry if this is too long.\n\nI was very close to a teacher at school when i was 15/16. She was a woman (29) and so am I. I suffered badly from panic attacks, anxiety, grief and depression. She would always comfort me and help me through it. She was caring and very good at teaching her subject. But some of her behaviour left me feeling very confused and uncomfortable. \n\nShe would discuss her personal life with me, including details about her relationship with her boyfriend and her sex life. She\u2019d say to me that i was one of her favourites, compliment my appearance sometimes and touch me often - like cradling my face or stroking my hair. She\u2019d often stare at me intently during class/around the school and mistakenly say my name when talking to another student or compliment me to other students.\n\nI found all of this really overwhelming and her intimidating. This led to me getting palpitations around her, feeling sick, weak/shaky or like i\u2019d pass out in her class. I couldn\u2019t eat my lunch before her lessons because i was afraid of how her behaviour made me feel. I always thought I just had a crush on her because she was a great teacher, attractive, and young. It made me question my sexuality at the time. \n\nAfter I left school in 2015, we stayed in touch for a few years through her school email very occasionally. I then found out that she\u2019d left the school and heard nothing from her for 4 years.\n\nI\u2019m now 24 and suddenly a few days ago, she emailed me through her personal email and I was shocked. I got the same feelings of nausea, shakiness and breathlessness that I got in her class. She said in the email that because it was International Women\u2019s Day, she thought of me and wanted to check how I am (odd?). She told me that she\u2019d left the school and also left teaching and she hopes i\u2019m \u201ccontinuing to be amazing\u201d.\n\nWhen i told my therapist about this all, she said that I had been groomed by my teacher at 15 and I was made to feel special by her, which then made me feel like I had a crush on her. \n\nI\u2019m finding it difficult to process because i thought this teacher was a good person and someone i missed, looked up to and loved. Am I in denial that I was groomed? Did she take advantage of me? I feel like what if I\u2019m making things up and the lines are blurry. The idea of \u201cbeing groomed\u201d makes me feel very upset, angry, almost \u2018dirty\u2019 and traumatised :(",

        "Question": "Came across my son's internet browsing history and I feel disgusted\nI am a 37 year old single mom to a 15 year old son. I was an orphan and was raised by my aunt and uncle who I didn't have a great relationship with and ended up running away at the age of 16. For 6 years after that I had been involved in a series of bad relationships and bad decisions and once my son was born, I promised myself that I would raise my son in a proper manner.\n\nI inculcated in him the idea of being open and sharing even if he he did something wrong. I never believed in punishment and always openly spoke and discussed things if he did something wrong. I worked as a waitress and for a while as a  stripper and have been subject to harassment quite often.  I was really disgusted with some of the men and I made sure that I thought my son the importance of respecting the human body. Growing up I was comfortable being nude around him till around a couple of years back where I started being a little conservative. I still pretty  comfortable being in underwear around him or walking around the house with no bra under my clothes.\n\nLast week, my laptop wasn't working, so I decided to use my son's computer. He wasn't home that day and I tried calling him to ask him if it was ok to use his computer. He didn't answer and I desperately wanted to get some work done, so I decided to use it anyway. Luckily I knew his pin and I was able to login. A part of me knew that as a teenager, he probably would be seeing porn, so I kept myself ready not to be judgemental and I even went to the extent of opening up an incognito window. I didn't realize that even in incognito, the auto suggest showed history. I was appalled when I saw my son has been watching incest themed porn, specifically mother and son.\n\nI don't know what to do and how to confront him. One one hand I don't want to show that I broke his trust and accessed his personal computer. I've personally done some research and also found out that this sort of porn  was not really uncommon . Ever since that day, I've been feeling uncomfortable about being around my son and feel a little violated . I want to talk to him about it, but I'm unsure how to go about it .\n\nEdit: Thank you for your advice, I've decided that I will see a therapist for myself first. Some of you pointed out that I shouldn't be roaming around in my underwear in front of my son , but do you think that is really something that has gotten inside my sons head? For e.g. How do we define what is appropriate or what is in appropriate? \n\nIt could be that I am over thinking things. My biggest fear is losing my son. He has been a constant in my life and it scares me knowing that I might push him away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

My husband of 15 years, been together 25 did something that really upset me a month and a half ago, and instead of apologizing, he has been acting like I don't exist..(which is the cycle in our marriage, it happens almost every month) not talking to me, acknowledging me..just spending all of his time with our kids until there a huge blow up and we rencile after months and months of this treatment.\n\nWell, one of our daughter's friends mom is a widow. My husband has jokingly said in the past that if anything happens to me that she can be his sugar mama as she has a full time job and a house and I'm a stay at home mom with no income coming in.\n\nWell, we're at a soccer game the other day and our daughters (mine and the daughter of widow )are playing in the gym. I'm sitting next to my husband on the bleachers and we're not talking. I look over and he's texting the mom asking if she was able to make it (she wasn't there yet). I flipped out, demanded to see the phone and its a bunch of texts.\n\nSome background..our daughter went over for a playdate a couple weeks ago and my husband picked her up. They didn't come home for an hour, even though they live 10 minutes away. When I asked my daughter why it took so long, she said that the girls didn't want to stop playing and that my husband and the mom were in the kitchen talking.\n\nA week after that, we had her daughter here for a playdate. That night, husband texted a picture of our dog in the snow as he was taking her for a walk saying \" See, this is what you have to deal with when you have a dog lolol\" and then they were texting about that.\n\nThere were like 15 texts back and forth that I could see and a smiley a face from her that seemed to be in response to something he said that I think he quickly deleted before handing me the phone. I was SO upset and in the middle of a crowded gym so I really couldn't absorb everything. I know there was nothing sexual.\n\nI am so upset about this as I consider it cheating, but he is saying I'm crazy.

They have told me they have \"safety plans\" but won't go into detail what those plans are, except that they are designed to address bullying etc.  Clearly these plans are not working.\n\nI'm really thinking that either the school is trying to protect itself, or that the teachers and principal have had their wings clipped to the extent that they can't actually use discipline etc.  I'm at a loss as to what to do here.\n\nI'm thinking of either escalating to the school board and / or engaging the media at this point.

I may be biased but overall a mature and lovely person. She attends a newer public school, part of the inaugural kindergarten class so there for 5 years now. The school just put in a playground a few weeks ago and obviously the kids are all very excited. \n\nApparently, the admins have decided to put some rules in place, which makes sense in general. However, they have also assigned a group of students to be the \"safety committee\" to make sure the rules are being followed. These kids walk around during recess with clipboards and write names down. This doesn't sit right with me to begin with, but I'm having a hard time articulating why.\n\nI have not received a copy of the rules, but my kid says things like no running (um ok, shouldn't kids run and play outside?), 2 kids on the bars at a time, 5 \"tricks\" on bars (like flipping over), 20 swings on the swings.

My kid tried to speak to admins without bringing up the bully specifically, just the rules and committee in general, and was basically told these are the rules and to deal. \n\nToday the bully told my kids teacher that they are watching closely since my kid breaks rules often. My kids teacher said that doesn't seem fair but didn't do much about it and suggested my kid write a letter to the admins. \n\nAny advice on how to approach this and make strong arguments against a safety committee of kids and general dumb playground rules?",

Giving kids little jobs like Line Leader or Table Cleaner is a normal thing to do, but you have the kids switch out jobs every day or so, so everyone gets a turn, and you don't give some kids authority over other kids. There's no way that doesn't lead to bullying. I can almost guarantee that your kid isn't the only one getting unfairly targeted, so if you ask around the other parents you could get a whole group together to bring this up at a PTA meeting or something.",

        "Question": "I met up with my son after four years of no contact.\n \n\nOriginal Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/duplicates/11lcng9/my\\_son22m\\_cut\\_contact\\_with\\_me\\_43f\\_four\\_years\\_ago/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/duplicates/11lcng9/my_son22m_cut_contact_with_me_43f_four_years_ago/)\n\nFor the few that gave me actual advice, I went to meet up with my son without Max or my daughter. It was at a local coffee shop. I found him sitting in one of the booths at the coffee shop. He was on his phone. I was really scared. A part of me wanted to tackle him with a hug and beg for his forgiveness. Another part of me, wanted to leave before he noticed me. I said his name to get his attention. He didn't even leave his seat; he just looked at me and said hi. I asked if I could sit. I started asking about how is he doing. He said he was fine. I was about to apologize, but he interrupted me by saying, \"Before you apologize, I want to understand how the relationship between Max and you even started.\"\n\nI started telling him everything. When it came to mentioning my meet-ups, he interjected me and started asking me questions that were difficult to answer. He asked \"So all the times that you were going out you were lying to me about where were you going. Weren't you?\" I nodded. \"What about the times I asked to spend time with you? Did you lie to me so you meet up with Max instead?\" I started tearing up. It was hard being there. \"Did you miss out on events to be with Max? What about my birthday?\" That's when I started crying. He told me to save my tears. He said he figured that out soon after he learned about the relationship with Max. He just wanted to hear it from me. He then asked me if I was still with Max. I told him I was married to him and I have a daughter with him. He seemed to need a minute to process that.\n\nThen he started speaking. He told me he never had an issue with me dating or meeting someone. In fact, he hoped I found love. He understands that I needed companionship and a type of love he couldn't offer as my son. He told me throughout all these years he felt conflicted because both Max and I were both consenting adults and adults have a right to find happiness. My son admitted he shouldn't Max and was glad he didn't press charges. He said despite all of that, they were some things that he can't get over. He told me he can't get over the fact that I didn't take him into consideration when it came to pursuing the relationship. It was also hurtful to realize that I would value a romantic relationship to the point of being willing to throw away a close relationship with him for it. If I had the attitude of being done raising him and finally pursuing my own life, then that's valid, according to him. However, I would have no right to want to have a close relationship with him in return. Again, that's what he said he believes. He told me he wouldn't have forgotten me when he left for college. He would have wanted me to move close to him after he got a job if he couldn't move close to me. In this ideal world we would live close by so he we could still see each other even after he had a family.\n\nHe said he loves himself and his life too much to have back in my life.. My son said he works as a mechanical engineer now. He is engaged to the love of his life. She was also raised by a single mom like him until she was 16 when her stepdad into the picture. Both of them have welcomed him into the family. He told me his future in-laws and his fiance are his family now. He said he was getting a job near them.\n\nHe finally admitted that he just wanted closure before permanently cutting me off. He told me not to contact him or his family at all. He made it clear he wouldn't be there for me at my last stage of life or even come to my funeral. He made it clear he won't even hold my hand when I pass away. I won't have the privilege of knowing his fiance or his future kids. He made it clear that if his half-sister ever contacts him as an adult he'll be upfront on why he doesn't want a relationship with her. He said good bye to me and left. I cried so hard that I got the attention of the people in the coffee shop. I was crying on the way back home. I don't even know how therapy can even help. I never felt so much emotional pain in my life before. What do I do now?",

        "Question": "(Update): My ex-bestfriend, who is married to my ex-husband hired me to make a cake for her son's birth.\n Hi, guys. I have read your advice and suggestions. You all made some really good points. So, I decided to talk to my mom about it. I just needed her insights about this matter. She told me I should do what I want to do. My boyfriend also encouraged me to take the order. He says that if I had to stay to organize the dessert table he would be there for me. I took the order. And it turns out, it was my ex husband\u2019s idea to hire me. Because one of his colleagues recommended my services to him. And it was sort of short notice so I had to rush this. Anyways, I kept it strictly about business. I did take the payment in advance just like some of you have mentioned. I always ask for advance payments. I mostly maintained communication through email. I have an assistant who is also a family friend of mine to handle all communications. My ex-bsf tried many times to meet with me in person, but I told her to just email me because I do have cake orders for other people too. I only had to meet her 1 time in person regarding the order. She sent me the details of the party over the email. \n\nAnd like I mentioned it was a huge order. I didn\u2019t just have to make a birthday cake for the baby (it is pokemon themed). There were also cake pops, cupcakes and macarons. Luckily, I had my friend Marie over for some help (yes, I did pay her). So, like usual I went to deliver the cakes and other stuff for the party. There was already a table set at the venue. My boyfriend, Josh (35M) came with me to support me and to keep me away from my ex-husband and ex-bsf as much as possible. As I was busy with myself, my ex approached me and said hello. Ngl, seeing him after so many years my heart just stopped. This man has given me the worst pain you could possibly give to a human. I am glad I held my composure. I also said hello back. He tried to have a small talk with me by saying that he is sorry about how things went down and what he said and also I looked better than the last time he saw me. Then he drops a big bomb, he said all these years he has thought of me, wondering what I was doing even though he is happy with his married life. I was silent. I didn\u2019t say a word. He just kept spewing that he misses me and my cooking. My homemade french onion soup is still his favorite. He misses that every time he gets sick with a flu. I didn\u2019t know what to say. At that moment Josh noticed that my ex was making me uncomfortable and he rushed towards me with a fake emergency. He asked if I was ok, I said yes. \n\nAfter the table setting was done, I was about to leave, that\u2019s when I saw my ex-FIL along with other guests. He noticed me and came to give me a hug. My ex-FIL is a very humble man. In fact he was the only man who was on my side when I was going through a divorce with his son. He looked really happy to see me and asked me how I was. He started to chat with me. I talked to him about my business and he gave me some advice. He even talked to my boyfriend. He called Josh a \u201cpretty standard guy\u201d (whatever that means). Ex-FIL was nice and said he would suggest my services to his friends too. He insisted that I stay until lunch is served. I said no a couple of times but he managed to convince me. I only stayed for 1 more hour or so. But I was fine. I did notice that my ex-bsf was eyeing me from the corner. I was fine because Josh was beside me the whole time. I chatted with some guests. They appreciated my service. I didn\u2019t have any more conversations with my ex. I didn\u2019t even stay for the cake cutting. I left the first chance I got but my assistant stayed to make sure everything was fine and for the clean up. \n\nIt was overwhelming for me. I saw some of my old friends and my in-laws. My MIL avoided me and some of my old friends just said hello. Later that day I got a message from my ex-bsf on my work email that she liked my service and that her guests really liked my cakes and desserts. She also said sorry. That\u2019s not where it ends. I got to know from my friend Marie, who is still in contact with some of my old friend group that my ex-bsf is not happy with her marriage. When my ex and her are in public they would often fight a lot. They also fight on the day of their kid\u2019s birthday. Tbh I just told her to not bring me the gossip about her. But the silver lining is I got a huge fat check lol. I can finally buy a new sugar printer or maybe a good quality oven. Also, I just want to appreciate my boyfriend Josh. He has been incredibly supportive of me. He has protected me from my ex and ex-bsf like a knight. I think he deserves his own cake from me. \ud83d\ude09 And I know a lot of you told me not to take it. But I guess I am just a greedy Mr. Krabs who cares more about the money rather than being classy hehe. But this is the last time I will be taking any orders from them. I know they have a 3 yr old daughter whose birthday will be in 2 months. I think they might try to hire me again. I will not take it if that happens. \n\nP. S. Yes my ex-bsf did try to communicate with me during the party but I managed to avoid it thanks to Josh and my ex-FIL. My ex-FIL knows about my situation and my discomfort with my ex-bsf. He kept me busy with small talk.",

Download it and take it outside maybe 75 feet from her car and refresh the app. Take note of all devices that it picks up. Then got next to the car and refresh the app, if there is a tracker in or on the car you'll notice a new device appearing in the app. Look at the distance which is in meters, then walk around to different sides of the car, and look at the distance. The lower the distance means the closer you are to the Air Tag. The app should display Air Tag so it should be really easy to find in the app when looking at it. I'd also recommend maybe doing this search with her car at least 75 feet from all other cars and bluetooth device that are on phones and cars. It should be super easy to find. Good luck and keep us posted on the progress. Here's a [link for the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ble-scanner-4-0/id1221763603).",

        "Question": "Should I feel bad for not wanting to help my parents past age 25?\nMy parents recently told me that they cannot afford certain things and they need help, I live with them and I\u2019m 20 so I help out with bills every so often, I\u2019m the youngest I have an older sister and an older brother who both drained them of money for college, trips, etc. my brother has nothing to do with my parents because they drove him away and my sister works on and off but they don\u2019t expect her to contribute, she also dropped out of college that they were paying for. \n\nI recently started my own business and work full time so I can eventually go to school or fund my business for more return. They know I have a lot of money saved for my future and told me I will have to start helping out because my sister refuses to work full time and make money, they also don\u2019t expect her to pay bills or rent. \n\nThey ended up telling me that i have to pay them money for retirement because they had expectations that the child with the most money will take care of them, I barely started my life and it seems unfair for the youngest child to have to take care of my parents who are mid 60s when I am just learning my way around my personal life and business. I feel a huge burden on my shoulders because they made bad financial decisions and they are expecting money from me to fund their vacations , groceries for everyone , bills , cooking, cleaning etc. im starting to think of moving out but I feel bad because they did give birth to me and take care of me when I was a kid. \n\nI think they should ask my sister (22 f) to help or my brother (30 m), I can\u2019t take on their financial burden as I have to think about my future, I want a family of my own and children.\n\nWhat do I tell them? Do I stand my ground? Do I owe them money for taking care of me? They also let me use one of their cars to go to work, should I buy them a new car?\n\nEdit: these are the type of financial decisions my parents make;\nMy mother spent $500 on designer glasses but she can\u2019t pay for groceries so I have to pick up the slack.\nMy father retired early with no investments just a pension that can barely cover the mortgage and electric bill, he payed for my sisters college and struggles with those bills too.",

        "Question": "I (34F) caught my dad (71M) watching bestiality porn and found lots more in his history.\nMy parents (71M & 69F) are retired but my mother runs market stall of her crafts in our town once a month.\n\nI work freelance and have been abroad for the last years. I am back visiting them for a while and staying with them, I am sleeping in their guest bedroom in the basement where my dads PC also is. My mother is a technophobe, literally never uses a PC, doesn't even have an email address.\n\nI was helping my mum on her stall today, my dad drives her there and picks her up, I came home early because I wasn't feeling very well and went down to the basement to lie down. My dad was in there clearly watching porn and I was like OMG and he scrabbled around to turn it off. I left the room embarrassed and he came out and was angry at me saying that I should be helping my mum and then left the house to go there. I hadnt seen the screen fully but i noticed something absolutely black on the screen with the woman and I got a bad feeling. So I went on the computer and reopened the browser and the tabs were still open and it was all dogs having sex with women. I felt sick and I looked in his history and I found about 15-20 other records of porn in the last 3 months - 100% all of it was dogs having sex with women. All the timing was clearly when my mum is out at her stall.\n\nI think the bad feeling came from this... About 20 years ago when I was 13/14 my dad had some software program called 'Poser' which made 3D rendering of people. Once I came to talk to him while he was on the computer the screen is the opposite to the door but I saw something in the window that looked a dog having sex with a woman really fast as he minimized it. \n\nIt was windows XP with separate accounts his had a password but I saw him write it once and memorized it. I logged into his account and I found LOADS (seriously loads) of 3D rendered images of dogs having sex with women. I felt so sick, I was still a child. I deleted all the images and I uninstalled the program. I think this was my way of letting him know I knew and an attempt to make him stop. I told my sister (then 18F now 39F) about it cause I was really upset but that was it. \n\nThe next time I went on the computer my entire music collection had been deleted from my account as well as my downloading program had been uninstalled. I was pretty annoyed and I complained to my dad about it at dinner in front of my mum he got angry and was like WELL LOTS OF THINGS HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARING OFF THE COMPUTER RECENTLY HAVENT THEY?? I was so shocked by his reaction considering what his missing stuff was and I was a young girl it seemed audacious, I nearly said what is was to my mum but I was just too afraid.\n\nI decided to just leave it and try and try to forget about it. I told myself that at least it wasn't real porn with it in just these cgi cartoony things that don't have proper genitals. He changed his password and I never saw the new one.\n\nAfter catching him today and seeing all his porn choices in the history, I feel sick thinking he has been doing this this whole time since back then?\n\nI just don't know what to think or do. I don't know what to make of it. It doesn't seem like he wants to have sex with dogs himself but just see women with them. Is this a degradation thing? Is this messed up? Is he a secret pervert? Is this misogyny? Fetishism? \n\nI've been trying to look up help online but I only really seem to find stuff about people wanting/having sex with animals themselves - if he was into that would he not watch men have sex with dogs to imagine it is him? \n\nOther than this my dad is really great, he was an architect and is still an artist. He was a fun and warm and playful dad when I was young, he used to drive me to sports clubs all the time. He also warm and fun with my sisters kids now who love him the most out of everyone. I've never heard him say  anything thats made me think he is misogynistic or sexist. He is however very disorganized. My mother has always worked full time as well and she basically has to look after him to keep order. My mother is pretty emotional and can have bad mood swings and get shouty and she organises my dad but also has a go at him about it a lot and she is very dominating and can be belittling of others when she is mad.\n\nI thought when I was young maybe it was some sort of reaction to feeling demasculated (?) by my mum or something. I just wanted to forget cause aside from that I get on with him more than my mum and havent had issues with him, I also havent seen him angry like he was that day at dinner and even today it was unlike him to lash out at me about not helping my mum. \n\nI just don't know what to do. I think if my mum knew she would really go insane and probably chuck him out the house. I think she would be really hurt, it's messed my head up (although I saw it all) and I'm not married to him. They are in there 70s now and have been married nearly 50 years. \n\nI told my sister again and she said she thinks we should confront him but I just don't even know what to say. His previous reactions bother me also. She thinks we should try and get him to get help. She agreed she thinks my mum would be incredibly upset if she knew and it could be life ruining for her and thinks we should avoid telling her.\n\nI said maybe we could seek a professional therapist who specializes in this sort of thing and have a session and ask for advice from them on what to do before confronting him. But as I said I couldn't find anything I felt was appropriate so far, does anyone know of anyone/where for me to look for this issue?\n\nI'm also concerned because I know the possession of bestiality porn is illegal here in UK but I don't know about streaming it. He doesn't use a VPN or even an incognito window as I found the history in his browser. Could he get in trouble?\n\nI just feel physically sick and anxious about it. I wonder what else he might be doing.\n\nAm I over-reacting?\n\nPlease be gentle I've never actually posted on reddit before, I feel too embarrassed to ask friends for help. \n\nThanks in advance",

I doubt you confronting him will end well, your mom will most likely find out if you try to force him to stop or seek help.

        "Question": "My sister (F56) is angry with me (F51) for buying my nephew (M18) Plan B, and I've been getting harassed and accused of being inappropriate for it.\nI (F51) live with my husband Brian (M55) only around half an hour away from my sister Lisa (F56), BIL Harold (M55), and nephew Robby (M18). Robby's in his senior year of high school and he's honestly always been a good kid. I love that little brat.\n\nHowever, a few nights ago, I was in the middle of watching cobra kai while Brian was at work. I get a frantic call from Robby. I'll spare the details but he said that he had no money and was in emergency need of Plan B for his girlfriend (F18). He begged me not to tell his parents, and I agreed to it. It's worth noting that he doesn't have a car just yet, and apparently neither does his girlfriend. The kid was freaking out and screaming on the phone, so I took some time to calm him down and reassure him that his future was not ruined and everything was going to be okay.\n\nI went to the nearby CVS and even bought two Plan Bs in case this happens again in the future, and drove down to Robby. My sister and BIL were out for the night, and Robby couldn't thank me enough. I told him not to mention it and also advised him to stay careful in the future. Robby begged me to keep this between us, and I agreed to spare him embarrassment. Unfortunately, I got an angry call from Lisa the next morning, and she had found the other Plan B in Robby's bathroom drawer while she was cleaning the bathroom. She said it was out of line for me to go and do that behind her back, and that I should've told her and Harold. I said that Brian was freaking out and I didn't want to embarrass him or make him feel bad, but Lisa said I was an AH for interfering with her parenting, and that me \"advising him to stay careful in the future\" was an inappropriate thing to say to my own nephew. It's literally gotten to a point where Harold and even a couple of Lisa's friends have been messaging me. I haven't even told Brian about this to keep Robby's word. I wasn't judging him at all, I really was just trying to help.\n\nSince then, I've still been getting messages from Lisa, Harold, and their friends. I haven't responded to a single one, and I even posted to AITA about this before it got taken down. I got a lot of advice on giving Robby the talk, but I'm extremely worried about how inappropriate that's just going to look. But at the same time, I fear that Robby might be uneducated on this stuff, as Lisa and Harold have honestly always been weird about this. Where do I go from here?",
