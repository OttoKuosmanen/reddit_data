        "Question": "Mentally destroyed after discovering that my mother escorted / made porn as recently as 3 years ago\nAbsolutely scarring experience, I found this while doing something for her on her phone by accidentally finding a mortifying photo of an ad she had made. Haven\u2019t said anything to her as I wasn\u2019t meant to find out. This is affecting me really really really fucking badly, and need some clarity on this so I can get my mental condition back to being able to focus on university, work, and sleep.",

        "Aswer": "Hey OP.\n\nI was outed as a sex worker by the national press 6 years ago. I was out to everyone around me, bar my child, and I decided then that I would tell my child when old enough because other people were threatening to do it for me to try to embarrass me. It only would have embarrassed my child, like you are just now, if I hadn't prepared in advance.\n\nI laid the groundwork so that sex and sexuality, and women's choices were all discussed before I told my child. Then I told them slowly in an age appropriate way over the years. And they were fine. \n\nThey were fine because they were taught that any legal sex between consenting adults is a diverse subject that really has nothing to do with other people.",
