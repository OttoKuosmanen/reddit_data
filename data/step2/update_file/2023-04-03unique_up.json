I was out to everyone around me, bar my child, and I decided then that I would tell my child when old enough because other people were threatening to do it for me to try to embarrass me. It only would have embarrassed my child, like you are just now, if I hadn't prepared in advance.\n\nI laid the groundwork so that sex and sexuality, and women's choices were all discussed before I told my child. Then I told them slowly in an age appropriate way over the years. And they were fine. \n\nThey were fine because they were taught that any legal sex between consenting adults is a diverse subject that really has nothing to do with other people.",

He will use her ( & will have sex with her ) she is way to YOUNG to be with a man that old. **The ONLY reason he is with her is for sex** . Which she will give to him bc she is really stupid and thinks it is cool to be with him. She is really going to regret it when she is 18 ( or even younger ) as it will wreak her mind & ruin her life . As by that time she will be mentally a wreak from his emotional destruction of her . A grown man would NOT hang out with a young teen for anything  else .\n* This will **start her destruction of her mind** if she starts anything with him . He is a pedo. She is way out of her depth ( & **will NOT be able to stop him** doing what ever he wishes as well )  to her . She is a sitting duck to his abusive ways she is walking into a trap ( which will destroy her mind ) . As she is inexperienced immature , & a young teen that will be used by him & tossed aside .That will send her off the rails emotionally -> eg- she will get hypersexual ( could get prego or r\\*Ped then ) bc of her out of control behaviours . Leading often to drug / alcohol  & addictive behaviours to cope with the damage mentally this man will do to her ( or even his sicko friends  )  who he also might get to use her . For him to be chasing her he is already someone who doesn't care about her . ( abt her welfare & safety ) that means he is a real threat to her safety in every way . NOt just sexually. Predators have NO morals so won't care to not offer her up for the slaughter .\n* **Do NOT trust him around you either** . **DO NOT ever be alone with him** ( even with her )  She cannot help you at all ( she will be putty in his hands to manipulate , hurt & use ) . He could drug you both . And also attack you . He is a predator and could easily also be grooming her for others to also use. Or to drag in other gals for him & others to use for sex etc.\n* If she is a know it all ( **you will struggle to help her & stop her** ) you **can only try tell her of the real dangers that are real from him .** He is a pedo to be chasing her and **will be a risk to her safety in all ways .** A man has NO interest in a young teen except for sex. That is how young women go missing ( he could not just be a r\\*pist but also a sicko . And could get her sold off to anyone. She could also be nothing but a present  for him to sell to others also ( to make money off her ) . As mentioned if she thinks he cares she is very delusional  he will NOT in any way but to use her ( this is how so many young people get tricked into toxic volatile abusive relo's as teens are easy pray by predators who can easily twist , create , manipulate and pretend to them .  Young people are at high ***risk for trickery as they DO NOT have the mental capacity & skills present  to prevent it .*** ( even some adult women do not have it either ) so a young teen has ***NO hope of understanding the complexities around relo's & other people***  that will be used against her to trap her in a web of disgusting lies. They are nothing but putty in a groomers hands to be used very easily.\n* This man has his sights set on her for sex & grooming of her to be with him. He might just want sex ( but there is **NO way of knowing** if that is all he is after ) . As mentioned he might be setting her up for a big fall to be used & sold ( so he can make money off her ) . \n* If you want to save her tell on her ( tell parents if they care about her ) if not tell the police . She will hate you maybe , but it might just save her alot of heartache and pain as well & a mental disorder due to the mental anguish & abuse he will put her though .",

His response was \u201cI can never make you happy\u201dand I stopped and realized and thought about what he said to me that day. I still remember it clearly. He was right he can\u2019t make me happy only I can make myself happy and only he can make himself happy. And only you can make your happy. You will never be able to make your dad happy and your not on this planet to make him happy. If he can\u2019t do it on his own it\u2019s because he has issues that he needs to work on, like myself.

I was a little unsure about it at first because I thought it\u2019s going to change our relationship but no, everything\u2019s the same basically. We also have a friend who I call T because she\u2019s basically the focal point of the story. \n\nT is a trans woman. I get along with her really good until yesterday. I don\u2019t even know how it really came up but I talked with her and called my bf \"he\". She looked at me very pissed and told me to not misgender him, especially in her presence because it\u2019s disrespectful. I told her that he goes by both he AND they pronouns. She basically dismissed it and said that it\u2019s still disrespectful because by calling him \"him\" I\u2019m being cis-normative and borderline transphobic. \n\nEventually I brought my bf to us and asked him what he thinks because that\u2019s basically what\u2019s important. He said that it\u2019s fine because (again) he goes by both he and they pronouns. T was basically just like \"whatever\" and was kinda rude to me the whole evening. Didn\u2019t even say me goodbye, just walk straight past me. \n\nI talked with my bf about it again and apologised if I hurt him in any way but he said that it\u2019s okay. He then showed me messages of him and T and T told him that he shouldn\u2019t allow me misgendering him and that he can\u2019t let people walk over him. \n\nI honestly feel really bad about all of this.

        "Question": "My son (13) is a sociopath and tried to kill his sister (6). I want him out of our lives, what can I do?\nThis account was made as a throwaway three or four months ago, when I feared my son was trying to hurt my family. He proceeded to set the house on fire with his sister, my sister and two family dogs in it. He has been an escalating issue for several years (I will post my old draft below in comment) and at this point he went to stay with his dad while my family, now homeless, took emergency shelter at a hotel. Because of the arson, a social worker came to my daughter at school to check on her safety at home. General bases to cover like access to food and clothing, and if she was harmed in any way. They met with me after this, to let me know that my daughter has been sexually abused by my son. She is 6 and he is 13. I broke down hearing what the worker quoted to me and I still am. My poor daughter had never told me. From the time I guess this may have happened (from context of the social worker\u2019s retelling; I don\u2019t want to pressure her or ask questions), I can deduce she may have been as little as 3 or 4. She knows that I know and I told her she did the right thing. I\u2019m doing my best to take care of her in this situation, asked the worker how to talk to her so she can feel safe, and filed the report and will file a restraining order.\n\nThe police are beginning to look to speak with my son. There is a reason this worries me. Ideally, they find him, and he gets arrested or sent to a facility. If he is given benefit, he will do or say anything to get what he wants. I don\u2019t know what he\u2019ll do or say but I know nothing is off limits. The worker mentioned they\u2019d want to know if he was perpetuating abuse he was a victim of, so I have already prepared for the possibility that he accuses any family member, my boyfriend (my boyfriend has never been alone with either of them regardless of the fact that I trust him) or even myself of having abused him. I don\u2019t suspect he has been abused but to him, no casualty is too great to spare in order to get what he wants. Everything is a means to an end. We have endured suicide threats (that we took seriously), physical violence, running away, vandalism and now arson/attempted murder because he didn\u2019t get his way. \n\nI know I\u2019m supposed to still love him. I don\u2019t think I do. For the last year the house felt so tense when he was there. We were always on eggshells. Being away from him we feel like we finally have peace (with the exception of this news and him being involved in our lives again). All I want is to be done with him. I want to move forward with my daughter and never have him able to come near us or the possibility of him entering our lives. I know, big picture he needs to be away from people, guns and the internet and into serious therapy. Right now, I just want him out of our lives. How do I make sure this happens?",

I try to talk to people about it sometimes but most of the time they just dont listen or dont take it seriously. I was in a rly bad abusive relationship about 2 years ago but no one took it seriously because I'm a guy and no one believed me. all of this is just locked up in my head all day because no one knows about it. no one ever asks and if they did they wouldn't care. I have friends but they always lie to me. I know most of them r using me. I've gone to therapy counseling psychologists psychiatrists everything and nothing helps no matter what i say or do. I'm on 13 different medications right now most of which I'm taking double all the way up to 8x regular doses of. my parents dont rly care ab me and they never have. one time I disappeared for 3 weeks and they barely even noticed. didnt do anything no police report didnt even wonder where I was. they never rly talked to me or interacted w me at all as a child. I'm not rly sure if I grew up poor or if they just didnt give me anything because i slept on a bare mattress with no pillows sheets or blanket. i still have back problems from sitting on the floor all day on my computer since they didnt get me a chair or desk. i dont think I've ever been in love w anyone ever and I dont think ill ever b able to love someone. i dont think anyone will ever rly love me either. most of my family hates me most of my friends r fake. the only place I've ever felt real was on the internet but now this place is so dead theres no one to talk to ever. I try to tell people whats on my mind but no one ever responds. I honestly dont rly have any reason to stay in this town anymore. for months I've been thinking ab just disappearing one day and not coming back. I'm just so alone everyone I've ever cared ab is dead. all I want is someone who cares about me. I just want a fucking hug. I just want someone to love me because aft all the shit I've been thru I fuckin deserve it. I dont know wtf to do. I'm so lost and I'm so scared. i dont think  i deserve this",

        "Question": "Introverted black single mom with no friends\nI'm 27F and very lonely. I have a 9 month old son and my ex has gone no contact and disappeared. My only friends think I'm gross for having sex and a baby before marriage. I'm not even Christian anymore. The only people who want to talk to me are creepy dudes who want a one night stand or want to get with a vulnerable woman to harm me more. I like white guys, I need to point that out, but most of them are rude and give me unsolicited opinions about how they'd never date a black woman or how I should have used protection and they wouldn't raise a black man's baby when I didn't ask them to. I'm just looking for friends and get that BS the moment I they find out. My mom hates me and her solution is to find another man. I work overnights so my parents can babysit and my coworkers hate me too. The nicest ones don't even speak English.\n\nI live in Mankato, Minnesota. Not many black people here, and the ones that are here are mostly from Somalia, a Muslim country, and most of them don't speak much English. I met some Somalian people a few years ago, but a lady I used to talk to a lot now says I should get back with my abusive ex because raising a baby without him goes against God, and I'm gross for not being married before sex. That's probably most of their culture's opinions. I'm so tired of religion being used against me and racist white people making me feel like dirt. I should move, but I don't know where I can go where I'd be welcome. I'm not trying to get with another man. I just want friends so I don't go insane. I don't know what I can do around here when I work overnights, sleep in the afternoons, and don't know people to go to bars with. (Don't want to drink either because I'm nursing.)\n\nI think I'm on the autism spectrum and stumble over my words when I'm talking in person along with feeling like crap and always embarrassed like a spotlight is on me.\n\nThanks for any advice.

I have also been getting out of a bad break up but he started touching me and pulling at my pants and one thing I did know. I did not want to have sex with this guy. I told him no and he started teasing that I'm hard. Which I was and I found that confusing because I 100% did not want to have sex with this guy. He kept pushing himself on me and picked me up putting on the sick. I told him NO! and I'm serious and started pushing at him but he just grabbed my hands and kept saying I do want it. I started crying at that point begging him not to rape me and that's when he stopped.  I was crying and he left me there. I pulled my pants back up and today recieved a text saying he's sorry if he scared me... But I feel odd that I had a boner when I did not want to have sex with him.

The management has been really awful and we have a high staff turnover. Up until recently we were not allowed any days off and if we were sick we were still expected to work as we could \u201cjust sit in the classroom and tell the children what to do\u201d. This kind of approach lead to 3 teachers leaving at once, resulting in me having to cover many new classes or even have 2 year levels in a class at once (which is difficult when they\u2019re on completely different curriculum/topics and need individual attention). \nA few weeks ago we hired more teachers so we could all have a lighter work load and be covered if someone was sick or needed a day off. The manager was the first one to take advantage of this and took a day off for a family birthday. So I also put in a request to have a day off as my partner is a professional athlete and will be playing in a very important final next week. I got the day approved and I worked out travel and accommodation for the match. That is until today, when she texted me to say that I can\u2019t have the day off anymore because she injured her foot  (a small cut with a couple of stitches) and is now on 2 weeks of sick leave, meaning I have to cover her classes. I didn\u2019t reply because I was extremely frustrated and didn\u2019t know how to respond so I went to the gym to blow off some steam. When I arrived at the gym I saw said manager working out on the treadmill and stair master. We didn\u2019t acknowledge each other. Now I don\u2019t know how to respond.

I did not take my placebo pill during a week I was already on my period. We are not usually sexually active during my period.  And were not this time. \n\n3. DIRECTLY after the week of placebo pills of this pack, I got an IUD inserted. \n\n4.

I know it does nothing whether I took it or not. What he\u2019s upset about is my decision to not take it without telling him.

I [18F] am currently watching two siblings (both under the age of 4), the oldest is still napping, but the youngest is a little girl and I just changed her diaper. When I went to wipe her, I saw a green and purple bruise spread across her entire bottom. It\u2019s very large. Could this be from spanking? I babysit for their best friends every other week as well, should I mention this to them? This is the first time I\u2019m sitting for them, the mom seemed very anxious but I just chalked it up to me being their first sitter ever. I was abused as a child but being in the situation of the grown up, I don\u2019t know what to do. Please help me. Do I take pictures of the bruise? What if nobody believes me without proof? Is that wrong?? I\u2019m going to check the oldest\u2019s bottom once he wakes up while I\u2019m changing him and see if there\u2019s something similar.\n\nUPDATE: The oldest\u2019s entire bottom and legs are bruised too. I have been able to take pictures of JUST their backs and the backs of the oldest\u2019s legs, as they have bruises all the way up their spines as well. Nothing from the photo could be taken as pornographic. I have looked at Mongolian Spots and didn\u2019t know about them prior to this issue, so thank you for those that have educated me. I did call the parents friends who I am very close with and trust, and they said they will help me out. I doubt that it\u2019s those though, they both have the same marks in the exact same spots and they\u2019re purple and look like bruises. I can see blood vessels. I\u2019ll keep y\u2019all updated.

Fast forward 17 years, I'm 28 now and my sister has two children of her own. Up until now, there's been no evidence of her abusing my nieces but my mom called me today and told me that the older of the two girls (10) was slammed up against a wall by my sister for \"mouthing off.\" For years, I've put off calling my sister in because it seemed that she was too scared of losing her social position to abuse the girls and that maybe she viewed her girls fundamentally different from me, and I figured that was at least better then a foster home. But now, I don't know what to do. I'm terrified for both of my nieces and feel deeply guilty that I haven't done anything until now, and feel like this has been going on for MUCH longer then we know if my sister was comfortable with casually bringing it up to my mom.",

He's an all around asshole, and I just hate him. About a year ago he was fishing on a boat, and it sank, 1 person who was onboard died, and ever since he's been a little more fucked than usual. He's done nothing but drink and get mad and yell ever since. Sure he did all of that stuff before on a weekly basis, but ever since it's been on about a daily basis. So for about a year he just didn't work whatsoever because he's been scared to go back on a boat, but since we're broke as shit he finally went back on the water for a week last week. Apparently they tormented him on the boat and kept playing tricks about the boat going down to fuck with him, so he came home and went on a 3 day bender, yelling and breaking shit for 3 days straight. My mom also happens to be pretty sick, and she's having lots of lung related problems,and she has to go in tomorrow overnight. And he wants me to stay tomorrow to keep him company. Now the thing is, I know if I stay, I'm probably not going to leave my room once so I don't see what difference it makes. On top of that I've already missed a lot of school recently, and while he was on his bender I didn't leave my room for 3 days, so I haven't eaten in 3 days, because I obviously didn't want to go out and deal with him screaming and breaking shit, so for that reason alone I think he deserves to be alone for a day.

        "Question": "My (50F) son (15M) has become a far-right extremist and I have no idea what to do\n \n\nThrowaway account because this is too embarrassing.\n\nFor some context, my son is on the spectrum and has difficulty forming relationships with people as a result, although he still has a few in person friends. He's extremely intelligent, and knows many things, especially when he puts his mind to it. I also know he uses a lot of social media, since it's easier for him to make friends that way, however I did not monitor them which I regret doing.\n\nThe first red flag was when he was 13 and he began talking to me about various statistics which he said proved that the races were not equal, like crime and IQ, and when I pointed out there are societal reasons for this, he went on a rant and said that that these are actually biological (I still don't know what his sources are). At that time I just chalked it up to him not understanding the world very well and assumed he would grow out of it, but it has only gotten worse in every way.\n\nHe ordered a copy of Mein Kampf to our home. Fortunately, I saw the package and threw it away before he could get his hands on it, but when I confronted him about it, he started screaming and telling me that all his online friends and he started a reading group where they would read books together and they started with Mein Kampf, and that now he would be left out. I asked him if any of his friends at school were reading Mein Kampf, and he said that they were \"normies\" who didn't understand reality. I asked him if he thought I was a \"normie\" too, and he went on an incredibly misogynistic tirade against me saying that I was a \"whore\" and a \"roastie\" (I looked up what it meant later and I was horrified) for pursuing my career (which has provided our family with lots of money, including that he benefits from!) and for openly talking about my past relationships before I met his father, and also because his father and were never married and now separated. He told me he hated me for ruining his life by waiting \"so long\" to have children which is why he was on the spectrum and had difficulty talking to people (many of my friends had children at my age and they did not have children on the spectrum, not that it's a problem anyway). And that was only the beginning, I do not wish to go into more detail, but I couldn't even say anything to him as I broke down crying. I loved my son and we were so close until that point and never before had anything so mean ever been said to me. I couldn't handle it. I didn't understand why he would say such horrible things to me, or how he could have learned such ideas. I am a progressive, and especially feminist, and I thought I was raising our son to hold the same values, but he became the complete opposite of what I wanted him to be.\n\nIn the aftermath of this, I confiscated his computer and phone, although I did let him send one last message to his horrible \"friends\" since he wouldn't stop screaming to us about how he couldn't just abandon them without saying anything. However, this did not help in any way. He began spending more and more time outside the house, which I thought was a good thing and that maybe he was socializing with his peers who didn't accept this sort of thing. I also noticed over the next few months that he was getting more and more muscular, I was proud of him, but I also did not want him to believe he had to prove his \"manliness\" by getting big muscles, he then cursed me out and told me I was trying to make him a \"soyboy\" (a term I did not know and had to look up) so he didn't care what I had to say. Eventually I find out he somehow managed to find a skinhead gang after school and they workout together... after I saw him with them, I screamed at him and then at them that they as grown men should stop trying to manipulate a teenage boy and there was no reason for him to spend time with strange men in their 20s and 30s.\n\nAfter that, I was very strict about everything he was doing. I would pick him up and drop him off, even though it meant I needed to take off time from work to do so. When I dropped him off at home, I locked the doors to make sure he could not escape before returning to work. However, this did not work either, and eventually I was called by the school principle who let us know that he and his school friends (who he has also convinced to become Nazis now!) had beaten a group of POC boys up and that he and his friends would receive a suspension as a result. I was so livid. I could not imagine the fact I was raising a future criminal, and he told me that I was a traitor for not being proud of him for being stronger than them and for beating up \"murderers of our people, rapists of our women, and invaders of our lands\". No reason can get to him, and no discipline can get to him. And now I AM SUFFERING THE CONSEQUENCES TOO, all my friends now assume I must be a racist because of my son, and don't want to spend time with me anymore. The other parents at the school avoid me. People who used to be friendly are now cold. I have no idea how to deal with this situation, can anyone here on Reddit give me good advice?",

Dad sleeps on the nastiest couch with the dogs (we adopted before mom passed). I want to completely tear down the house and build a new one. He just wants to start on fixing the house by \u201cexpanding the closed off bedroom\u201d.

He also threw a drawer straight down on the floor because of how worked up he was. Once again none of it was at me or directed towards me in any way. But my dad felt like you shouldn\u2019t talk to my daughter in that way-\u201cshe\u2019s a lady.\u201d When he confronted my fianc\u00e9 my fianc\u00e9 said \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have acted that way BUT-I was mad. My dad blew up because he felt since my fianc\u00e9 had to throw a BUT in there-he wasn\u2019t actually that sorry.\n\n\nI was raised by a single dad. My dad has a lot of faults-one of him is the way he talks to people is disrespectful and he has a temper. He never physically hurts anyone but he\u2019s not afraid of cussing someone out. I know he has wrongs but I also see the damaged side of him and what he went through after mom left. So I still love him for all the years he was hurt and raised me. \n\nAbout 2 months ago my dad got in a huge fight with my fianc\u00e9. My fianc\u00e9 was initially in the wrong. Dad got to the point where he went to my fianc\u00e9s work and cussed him out in front of his boss. And then went and told my fianc\u00e9s parents all his issues he has with me marrying my fianc\u00e9. \n\nI called my dad and yelled at him and told him he went way to far and didn\u2019t talk to him hardly for like 2 or 3 weeks. But I still love dad. As wrong as he may be. My fianc\u00e9 has not dropped it since. He brings it up about once a week how much of a jerk my dad is and how much he hates him. After I told him he needed to let it go because it was causing us to fight he stopped talking about it as much. But still brings it up occasionally. I try to let him get his temper out but then he will say something like I never want your dad at the house again. If you want to see him it can\u2019t be on my property. And I think to myself he hates my dad so much that he\u2019s willing to hurt my relationship with my dad because of what he did? Like I feel at that point he\u2019s ok with hurting me. \n\nI try to explain to my fianc\u00e9 that I know my dad did a bad thing but I feel he doesn\u2019t care about my feelings when he\u2019s making me take half the punishment by saying I don\u2019t want your dad to ever come over and see our new house. But he sees it as me defending my dads behavior. I\u2019ve tried to make him see my perspective for months. And I\u2019m also trying to register how much my dad embarrassed him and of how my fianc\u00e9 is acting is justified in any way\u2026..\n\nShould I break this or not?",

        "Question": "My boyfriend (23m) is a dealer and won\u2019t get a legal job what do\nHello everyone, I (22f) am having a hard time with my bf (23m). We have been together for almost 6 years, as the title states he is a dealer. I have been trying to encourage him to get a job for years, and he acts like a complete man child about it, he has a temper problem when it comes to any kind of authority over him. Other than that we really don\u2019t get into disagreements so it makes this harder for me. When we started dating we only did it because it was what we had to do if we wanted food or shelter, but now he\u2019s became lazy. He just wants fast easy ways to get rich (y\u2019all don\u2019t even know how many crypto scams I have prevented him from giving our savings to) and not put in effort for anything he wants in life. Obviously I can\u2019t just change him and make him work, but idk what to do anymore and I\u2019m tired of it. To make things worse I\u2019m a very introverted person and don\u2019t have any near friends I could just move in with if I decided to leave. I hate saying I\u2019m with him only for financial reasons because I do really love him, but ultimately if I had the money I would have been gone long ago. He just keeps saying he\u2019s going to get a job as an \u201centrepreneur\u201d but as I said he wants everything handed to him with no effort.  Anyways what can or should I do?",

A budgie/parakeet and a canary. They both live in separate cages. Their cages are kept in a back sunroom. It seems I forgot to lock the outside access door when I went out (have had lots on my mind recently). When home I found they had been stabbed, cut up, inside their cages, blood and feathers. No valuables are kept in this room and I'm unsure if anything is missing. This is quite disturbing.\n\nThey are only small birds but were pets.

        "Question": "I just want my name change to be respected.\nI\u2019m going to try to make all of this simple to you guys since it\u2019s rocket-science to my family that I wanted a feminine name and gave it to myself. I just wanted to feel satisfied. \n\nI was born with a name that I did not like, so I changed it last year when I was 19. I\u2019m 20 now and my family still can\u2019t get with the program. I changed my name because I always hated it. My mom named me something so masculine. Before you guys get on me, I\u2019m aware that gender neutral names exist but this wasn\u2019t that. This wasn\u2019t a \u201cJordan\u201d or \u201cAlex\u201d situation. She named me after a famous male actor because she thought he was sexy and she\u2019d never heard of a girl with his name before. She said I was going to be named that no matter if I was a boy or girl. Then, to make shit even worse, she gave me a feminine middle name. I\u2019d been getting comments and questions about my name since I was in elementary school and I was seven years old telling myself that I\u2019d change my name because I was just so tired. I just wanted to not be embarrassed. \n\nThe last straw that lead me to change my name was when I was at work and a guy asked me my name. I told him and he raised a brow and asked \u201cLike the actor?\u201d and I told him yes. Then, he proceeded to say \u201cWell, you\u2019re still beautiful anyway\u201d and left. That was when I started the process of legally filing to change my name. \n\nWhen the name change did finalize and happen, my mom just couldn\u2019t understand my choice. She compared it to how transgender people change their gender (I couldn\u2019t get a grip on her comparison) and she compared my name to her name, saying she\u2019d been teased all her life but her name is very much just feminine and Biblical. People know she\u2019s a woman before they see her face but I had people thinking I was a guy before they ever even saw me because my name was so masculine.  She said I should\u2019ve took that as a good thing and used every excuse in the book to avoid understanding my perspective. She even said it was disrespectful. Disrespectful for me to want a girly name so that I can live within my girly self? Disrespectful for me to not want to feel bad when people made unnecessary comments and said that my birth name was a \u201cboy name\u201d? \n\nRegardless of me changing my name, my family still continues to call me by my old name. I\u2019ve tried to reenforce it but they just won\u2019t listen. However, they always expect me to respect them but deliberately choose to ignore my wishes. Only a FEW people in my family try to respect my name change and best believe I can only count on one hand. I\u2019ve received better support from friends. My dad told me on the phone that he would still call me by my birth name but he still mixes it up and calls me by both names. My big sister says she\u2019s not calling me by my new name because she\u2019s not used to it and I don\u2019t look like the name that I\u2019ve picked. Sometimes I feel like I\u2019ve done this for no reason. \n\nI\u2019m going to the military sometime this year and I\u2019ve made it a goal to get this respect thing situated. I\u2019m old enough to receive the same respect the adults in my family expect from me so if they\u2019re still doing this to me when I join, I\u2019m cutting them off. I even told myself that they\u2019d be banned from my wedding if I get married and even the birth of my children if I have any if they can\u2019t respect my choice. My wedding invites and baby shower invites would say my new name and I don\u2019t need any confusion or embarrassment when my family meets my future husband\u2019s family. The way my family is acting, they\u2019re going to miss out on all that stuff. \n\nIt\u2019s not THAT hard to call someone what they want to be called and I don\u2019t know what I can do to change them from being ignorant.\n\nEDIT: Why would my mom throw trans people in the mix when if I did want to be trans, I\u2019d have to take one less step considering the fact that my name literally used to be masculine? She set me up with a masculine name anyway so I wouldn\u2019t have had to change my name if I wanted to be a male. It makes no sense. Give a girl a masculine name and then get mad at her for wanting a feminine name instead? Am I wrong?",

My gf always wanted a third bathroom to be added which isnt a problem to me, because the two bathrooms are in the middle and basement floor respectively. \n\nUpon getting the house inspection done, it has been revealed that the water heater, and hvac system is 3-4 years past its  life expectancy and i would like to have that replaced before all other improvements are made. To me, it takes more of a priority over a bathroom because #1, a third bathroom isnt absolutely needed, Its more of a want imo and #2, the other two bathrooms have been renovated and look very good aesthetically. \n\nMy gf doesnt look at the hvac situation as seriously as i do and is dead set on this bathroom. She doesnt seem to be budging on this. What do you guys think? Btw, i would do both repairs/additions at the same time, but money plays a factor. The price to add a bathroom could be the same or more as the hvac system. We haven\u2019t moved in or gotten proper estimates yet.",

        "Question": "Was I groomed by my teacher at 15? My therapist says I was. I\u2019m now 24 and the teacher is suddenly emailing me.\nThis is my first time using Reddit, so apologies in advance if i\u2019m doing anything incorrectly and sorry if this is too long.\n\nI was very close to a teacher at school when i was 15/16. She was a woman (29) and so am I. I suffered badly from panic attacks, anxiety, grief and depression. She would always comfort me and help me through it. She was caring and very good at teaching her subject. But some of her behaviour left me feeling very confused and uncomfortable. \n\nShe would discuss her personal life with me, including details about her relationship with her boyfriend and her sex life. She\u2019d say to me that i was one of her favourites, compliment my appearance sometimes and touch me often - like cradling my face or stroking my hair. She\u2019d often stare at me intently during class/around the school and mistakenly say my name when talking to another student or compliment me to other students.\n\nI found all of this really overwhelming and her intimidating. This led to me getting palpitations around her, feeling sick, weak/shaky or like i\u2019d pass out in her class. I couldn\u2019t eat my lunch before her lessons because i was afraid of how her behaviour made me feel. I always thought I just had a crush on her because she was a great teacher, attractive, and young. It made me question my sexuality at the time. \n\nAfter I left school in 2015, we stayed in touch for a few years through her school email very occasionally. I then found out that she\u2019d left the school and heard nothing from her for 4 years.\n\nI\u2019m now 24 and suddenly a few days ago, she emailed me through her personal email and I was shocked. I got the same feelings of nausea, shakiness and breathlessness that I got in her class. She said in the email that because it was International Women\u2019s Day, she thought of me and wanted to check how I am (odd?). She told me that she\u2019d left the school and also left teaching and she hopes i\u2019m \u201ccontinuing to be amazing\u201d.\n\nWhen i told my therapist about this all, she said that I had been groomed by my teacher at 15 and I was made to feel special by her, which then made me feel like I had a crush on her. \n\nI\u2019m finding it difficult to process because i thought this teacher was a good person and someone i missed, looked up to and loved. Am I in denial that I was groomed? Did she take advantage of me? I feel like what if I\u2019m making things up and the lines are blurry. The idea of \u201cbeing groomed\u201d makes me feel very upset, angry, almost \u2018dirty\u2019 and traumatised :(",

        "Question": "Came across my son's internet browsing history and I feel disgusted\nI am a 37 year old single mom to a 15 year old son. I was an orphan and was raised by my aunt and uncle who I didn't have a great relationship with and ended up running away at the age of 16. For 6 years after that I had been involved in a series of bad relationships and bad decisions and once my son was born, I promised myself that I would raise my son in a proper manner.\n\nI inculcated in him the idea of being open and sharing even if he he did something wrong. I never believed in punishment and always openly spoke and discussed things if he did something wrong. I worked as a waitress and for a while as a  stripper and have been subject to harassment quite often.  I was really disgusted with some of the men and I made sure that I thought my son the importance of respecting the human body. Growing up I was comfortable being nude around him till around a couple of years back where I started being a little conservative. I still pretty  comfortable being in underwear around him or walking around the house with no bra under my clothes.\n\nLast week, my laptop wasn't working, so I decided to use my son's computer. He wasn't home that day and I tried calling him to ask him if it was ok to use his computer. He didn't answer and I desperately wanted to get some work done, so I decided to use it anyway. Luckily I knew his pin and I was able to login. A part of me knew that as a teenager, he probably would be seeing porn, so I kept myself ready not to be judgemental and I even went to the extent of opening up an incognito window. I didn't realize that even in incognito, the auto suggest showed history. I was appalled when I saw my son has been watching incest themed porn, specifically mother and son.\n\nI don't know what to do and how to confront him. One one hand I don't want to show that I broke his trust and accessed his personal computer. I've personally done some research and also found out that this sort of porn  was not really uncommon . Ever since that day, I've been feeling uncomfortable about being around my son and feel a little violated . I want to talk to him about it, but I'm unsure how to go about it .\n\nEdit: Thank you for your advice, I've decided that I will see a therapist for myself first. Some of you pointed out that I shouldn't be roaming around in my underwear in front of my son , but do you think that is really something that has gotten inside my sons head? For e.g. How do we define what is appropriate or what is in appropriate? \n\nIt could be that I am over thinking things. My biggest fear is losing my son. He has been a constant in my life and it scares me knowing that I might push him away.\n\n&#x200B;\n\n&#x200B;",

My husband has jokingly said in the past that if anything happens to me that she can be his sugar mama as she has a full time job and a house and I'm a stay at home mom with no income coming in.\n\nWell, we're at a soccer game the other day and our daughters (mine and the daughter of widow )are playing in the gym. I'm sitting next to my husband on the bleachers and we're not talking. I look over and he's texting the mom asking if she was able to make it (she wasn't there yet). I flipped out, demanded to see the phone and its a bunch of texts.\n\nSome background..our daughter went over for a playdate a couple weeks ago and my husband picked her up. They didn't come home for an hour, even though they live 10 minutes away. When I asked my daughter why it took so long, she said that the girls didn't want to stop playing and that my husband and the mom were in the kitchen talking.\n\nA week after that, we had her daughter here for a playdate. That night, husband texted a picture of our dog in the snow as he was taking her for a walk saying \" See, this is what you have to deal with when you have a dog lolol\" and then they were texting about that.\n\nThere were like 15 texts back and forth that I could see and a smiley a face from her that seemed to be in response to something he said that I think he quickly deleted before handing me the phone. I was SO upset and in the middle of a crowded gym so I really couldn't absorb everything. I know there was nothing sexual.\n\nI am so upset about this as I consider it cheating, but he is saying I'm crazy.

It\u2019s intent is to keep you anxious, in doubt, confused and desperate for their attention, while ensuring you learn your lesson to not slip up again - ie.

There have been 4 occurrences within the last 6 weeks of bullying to the extent that my daughter is throwing up before school due to anxiety and has now missed a number of days.  This is Kindergarten for Christ's sake.\n\nWe have sent 4 emails detailing each occurrence.  The teachers and principal are involved, and after the 3rd occurrence, the parents of the bully were informed.  After this 4th occurrence we again sent an email and the principal essentially responded with \"all we can do is inform the other parents\".\n\nThis tells me that the school cannot address bullying.  They have told me they have \"safety plans\" but won't go into detail what those plans are, except that they are designed to address bullying etc.  Clearly these plans are not working.\n\nI'm really thinking that either the school is trying to protect itself, or that the teachers and principal have had their wings clipped to the extent that they can't actually use discipline etc.  I'm at a loss as to what to do here.\n\nI'm thinking of either escalating to the school board and / or engaging the media at this point.

These ideas obviously come from movies ect. so I asked myself how I would be able to play another \u201crole\u201d in the \u201cmovie\u201d instead of the victim.\n\nI came to the conclusion, that if in that instance where I was walking through the dark, *I* was actually the crazy person or the \u201chunter\u201d instead of the \u201cprey\u201d then the roles would change. \n\nSo then for a good while when I was I think 13+ I just laughed like a maniac when I was alone at home in the dark as to show that I\u2019m the \u201cpredator of the movie\u201d or some crazy person out to kill all the monsters, the \u201cmonster of the monsters\u201d so to speak xD\n\nI think I did this for a year or so until I wasn\u2019t afraid of the dark anymore whatsoever. Or to put it better, the fear just didn\u2019t bother me anymore and I further trained/tested this by going into the forest alone at night when I was 18+ \n\nHope this helps somehow. Start with not being afraid of your fear or accepting that you are afraid of your fear. Getting into a role can help with that, just watch out you don\u2019t get too attached to that role :)",

        "Question": "How do I ask school admins to change playground rules?\nI have a really great 10 year old 4th grader. Smart, funny, kind and helpful. I may be biased but overall a mature and lovely person. She attends a newer public school, part of the inaugural kindergarten class so there for 5 years now. The school just put in a playground a few weeks ago and obviously the kids are all very excited. \n\nApparently, the admins have decided to put some rules in place, which makes sense in general. However, they have also assigned a group of students to be the \"safety committee\" to make sure the rules are being followed. These kids walk around during recess with clipboards and write names down. This doesn't sit right with me to begin with, but I'm having a hard time articulating why.\n\nI have not received a copy of the rules, but my kid says things like no running (um ok, shouldn't kids run and play outside?), 2 kids on the bars at a time, 5 \"tricks\" on bars (like flipping over), 20 swings on the swings. So the safety committee stands around with clipboards and write down names of rule violaters and if your name gets on the list 3 times you go to the principal. \n\nThis by itself just sounds so stupid to me so I'm looking for advice on how to approach this with the school. \n\nAdd to it that it seems no one informed the kids about the safety committee so all of a sudden there's just a bunch of narcs floating around giving kids anxiety about the threat of being in trouble.\n\nTop it all off with the fact that one of the kids on the safety committee was bullying my kid last year (nothing major but it was a friend that was jealous my kid was starting to spend time with other friends and bad enough that the bully was moved to a different class). So this bully is now targeting my kid and basically standing there watching them specifically every day. My kid tried to speak to admins without bringing up the bully specifically, just the rules and committee in general, and was basically told these are the rules and to deal. \n\nToday the bully told my kids teacher that they are watching closely since my kid breaks rules often. My kids teacher said that doesn't seem fair but didn't do much about it and suggested my kid write a letter to the admins. \n\nAny advice on how to approach this and make strong arguments against a safety committee of kids and general dumb playground rules?",

What are their teachers doing during recess? Why aren't they able to supervise? Giving kids little jobs like Line Leader or Table Cleaner is a normal thing to do, but you have the kids switch out jobs every day or so, so everyone gets a turn, and you don't give some kids authority over other kids. There's no way that doesn't lead to bullying. I can almost guarantee that your kid isn't the only one getting unfairly targeted, so if you ask around the other parents you could get a whole group together to bring this up at a PTA meeting or something.",

        "Question": "I met up with my son after four years of no contact.\n \n\nOriginal Post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship\\_advice/duplicates/11lcng9/my\\_son22m\\_cut\\_contact\\_with\\_me\\_43f\\_four\\_years\\_ago/](https://www.reddit.com/r/relationship_advice/duplicates/11lcng9/my_son22m_cut_contact_with_me_43f_four_years_ago/)\n\nFor the few that gave me actual advice, I went to meet up with my son without Max or my daughter. It was at a local coffee shop. I found him sitting in one of the booths at the coffee shop. He was on his phone. I was really scared. A part of me wanted to tackle him with a hug and beg for his forgiveness. Another part of me, wanted to leave before he noticed me. I said his name to get his attention. He didn't even leave his seat; he just looked at me and said hi. I asked if I could sit. I started asking about how is he doing. He said he was fine. I was about to apologize, but he interrupted me by saying, \"Before you apologize, I want to understand how the relationship between Max and you even started.\"\n\nI started telling him everything. When it came to mentioning my meet-ups, he interjected me and started asking me questions that were difficult to answer. He asked \"So all the times that you were going out you were lying to me about where were you going. Weren't you?\" I nodded. \"What about the times I asked to spend time with you? Did you lie to me so you meet up with Max instead?\" I started tearing up. It was hard being there. \"Did you miss out on events to be with Max? What about my birthday?\" That's when I started crying. He told me to save my tears. He said he figured that out soon after he learned about the relationship with Max. He just wanted to hear it from me. He then asked me if I was still with Max. I told him I was married to him and I have a daughter with him. He seemed to need a minute to process that.\n\nThen he started speaking. He told me he never had an issue with me dating or meeting someone. In fact, he hoped I found love. He understands that I needed companionship and a type of love he couldn't offer as my son. He told me throughout all these years he felt conflicted because both Max and I were both consenting adults and adults have a right to find happiness. My son admitted he shouldn't Max and was glad he didn't press charges. He said despite all of that, they were some things that he can't get over. He told me he can't get over the fact that I didn't take him into consideration when it came to pursuing the relationship. It was also hurtful to realize that I would value a romantic relationship to the point of being willing to throw away a close relationship with him for it. If I had the attitude of being done raising him and finally pursuing my own life, then that's valid, according to him. However, I would have no right to want to have a close relationship with him in return. Again, that's what he said he believes. He told me he wouldn't have forgotten me when he left for college. He would have wanted me to move close to him after he got a job if he couldn't move close to me. In this ideal world we would live close by so he we could still see each other even after he had a family.\n\nHe said he loves himself and his life too much to have back in my life.. My son said he works as a mechanical engineer now. He is engaged to the love of his life. She was also raised by a single mom like him until she was 16 when her stepdad into the picture. Both of them have welcomed him into the family. He told me his future in-laws and his fiance are his family now. He said he was getting a job near them.\n\nHe finally admitted that he just wanted closure before permanently cutting me off. He told me not to contact him or his family at all. He made it clear he wouldn't be there for me at my last stage of life or even come to my funeral. He made it clear he won't even hold my hand when I pass away. I won't have the privilege of knowing his fiance or his future kids. He made it clear that if his half-sister ever contacts him as an adult he'll be upfront on why he doesn't want a relationship with her. He said good bye to me and left. I cried so hard that I got the attention of the people in the coffee shop. I was crying on the way back home. I don't even know how therapy can even help. I never felt so much emotional pain in my life before. What do I do now?",

You all made some really good points. So, I decided to talk to my mom about it. I just needed her insights about this matter. She told me I should do what I want to do. My boyfriend also encouraged me to take the order. He says that if I had to stay to organize the dessert table he would be there for me. I took the order. And it turns out, it was my ex husband\u2019s idea to hire me. Because one of his colleagues recommended my services to him. And it was sort of short notice so I had to rush this. Anyways, I kept it strictly about business. I did take the payment in advance just like some of you have mentioned. I always ask for advance payments. I mostly maintained communication through email. I have an assistant who is also a family friend of mine to handle all communications. My ex-bsf tried many times to meet with me in person, but I told her to just email me because I do have cake orders for other people too. I only had to meet her 1 time in person regarding the order. She sent me the details of the party over the email. \n\nAnd like I mentioned it was a huge order. I didn\u2019t just have to make a birthday cake for the baby (it is pokemon themed). There were also cake pops, cupcakes and macarons. Luckily, I had my friend Marie over for some help (yes, I did pay her). So, like usual I went to deliver the cakes and other stuff for the party. There was already a table set at the venue. My boyfriend, Josh (35M) came with me to support me and to keep me away from my ex-husband and ex-bsf as much as possible. As I was busy with myself, my ex approached me and said hello. Ngl, seeing him after so many years my heart just stopped. This man has given me the worst pain you could possibly give to a human. I am glad I held my composure. I also said hello back. He tried to have a small talk with me by saying that he is sorry about how things went down and what he said and also I looked better than the last time he saw me. Then he drops a big bomb, he said all these years he has thought of me, wondering what I was doing even though he is happy with his married life. I was silent. I didn\u2019t say a word. He just kept spewing that he misses me and my cooking. My homemade french onion soup is still his favorite. He misses that every time he gets sick with a flu. I didn\u2019t know what to say. At that moment Josh noticed that my ex was making me uncomfortable and he rushed towards me with a fake emergency. He asked if I was ok, I said yes. \n\nAfter the table setting was done, I was about to leave, that\u2019s when I saw my ex-FIL along with other guests. He noticed me and came to give me a hug. My ex-FIL is a very humble man. In fact he was the only man who was on my side when I was going through a divorce with his son. He looked really happy to see me and asked me how I was. He started to chat with me. I talked to him about my business and he gave me some advice. He even talked to my boyfriend. He called Josh a \u201cpretty standard guy\u201d (whatever that means). Ex-FIL was nice and said he would suggest my services to his friends too. He insisted that I stay until lunch is served. I said no a couple of times but he managed to convince me. I only stayed for 1 more hour or so. But I was fine. I did notice that my ex-bsf was eyeing me from the corner. I was fine because Josh was beside me the whole time. I chatted with some guests. They appreciated my service. I didn\u2019t have any more conversations with my ex. I didn\u2019t even stay for the cake cutting. I left the first chance I got but my assistant stayed to make sure everything was fine and for the clean up. \n\nIt was overwhelming for me. I saw some of my old friends and my in-laws. My MIL avoided me and some of my old friends just said hello. Later that day I got a message from my ex-bsf on my work email that she liked my service and that her guests really liked my cakes and desserts. She also said sorry. That\u2019s not where it ends. I got to know from my friend Marie, who is still in contact with some of my old friend group that my ex-bsf is not happy with her marriage. When my ex and her are in public they would often fight a lot. They also fight on the day of their kid\u2019s birthday. Tbh I just told her to not bring me the gossip about her. But the silver lining is I got a huge fat check lol. I can finally buy a new sugar printer or maybe a good quality oven. Also, I just want to appreciate my boyfriend Josh. He has been incredibly supportive of me. He has protected me from my ex and ex-bsf like a knight. I think he deserves his own cake from me. \ud83d\ude09 And I know a lot of you told me not to take it. But I guess I am just a greedy Mr. Krabs who cares more about the money rather than being classy hehe. But this is the last time I will be taking any orders from them. I know they have a 3 yr old daughter whose birthday will be in 2 months. I think they might try to hire me again. I will not take it if that happens. \n\nP. S. Yes my ex-bsf did try to communicate with me during the party but I managed to avoid it thanks to Josh and my ex-FIL. My ex-FIL knows about my situation and my discomfort with my ex-bsf. He kept me busy with small talk.",

Then got next to the car and refresh the app, if there is a tracker in or on the car you'll notice a new device appearing in the app. Look at the distance which is in meters, then walk around to different sides of the car, and look at the distance. The lower the distance means the closer you are to the Air Tag. The app should display Air Tag so it should be really easy to find in the app when looking at it. I'd also recommend maybe doing this search with her car at least 75 feet from all other cars and bluetooth device that are on phones and cars. It should be super easy to find.

        "Question": "Should I feel bad for not wanting to help my parents past age 25?\nMy parents recently told me that they cannot afford certain things and they need help, I live with them and I\u2019m 20 so I help out with bills every so often, I\u2019m the youngest I have an older sister and an older brother who both drained them of money for college, trips, etc. my brother has nothing to do with my parents because they drove him away and my sister works on and off but they don\u2019t expect her to contribute, she also dropped out of college that they were paying for. \n\nI recently started my own business and work full time so I can eventually go to school or fund my business for more return. They know I have a lot of money saved for my future and told me I will have to start helping out because my sister refuses to work full time and make money, they also don\u2019t expect her to pay bills or rent. \n\nThey ended up telling me that i have to pay them money for retirement because they had expectations that the child with the most money will take care of them, I barely started my life and it seems unfair for the youngest child to have to take care of my parents who are mid 60s when I am just learning my way around my personal life and business. I feel a huge burden on my shoulders because they made bad financial decisions and they are expecting money from me to fund their vacations , groceries for everyone , bills , cooking, cleaning etc. im starting to think of moving out but I feel bad because they did give birth to me and take care of me when I was a kid. \n\nI think they should ask my sister (22 f) to help or my brother (30 m), I can\u2019t take on their financial burden as I have to think about my future, I want a family of my own and children.\n\nWhat do I tell them?

        "Question": "I (34F) caught my dad (71M) watching bestiality porn and found lots more in his history.\nMy parents (71M & 69F) are retired but my mother runs market stall of her crafts in our town once a month.\n\nI work freelance and have been abroad for the last years. I am back visiting them for a while and staying with them, I am sleeping in their guest bedroom in the basement where my dads PC also is. My mother is a technophobe, literally never uses a PC, doesn't even have an email address.\n\nI was helping my mum on her stall today, my dad drives her there and picks her up, I came home early because I wasn't feeling very well and went down to the basement to lie down. My dad was in there clearly watching porn and I was like OMG and he scrabbled around to turn it off. I left the room embarrassed and he came out and was angry at me saying that I should be helping my mum and then left the house to go there. I hadnt seen the screen fully but i noticed something absolutely black on the screen with the woman and I got a bad feeling. So I went on the computer and reopened the browser and the tabs were still open and it was all dogs having sex with women. I felt sick and I looked in his history and I found about 15-20 other records of porn in the last 3 months - 100% all of it was dogs having sex with women. All the timing was clearly when my mum is out at her stall.\n\nI think the bad feeling came from this... About 20 years ago when I was 13/14 my dad had some software program called 'Poser' which made 3D rendering of people. Once I came to talk to him while he was on the computer the screen is the opposite to the door but I saw something in the window that looked a dog having sex with a woman really fast as he minimized it. \n\nIt was windows XP with separate accounts his had a password but I saw him write it once and memorized it. I logged into his account and I found LOADS (seriously loads) of 3D rendered images of dogs having sex with women. I felt so sick, I was still a child. I deleted all the images and I uninstalled the program. I think this was my way of letting him know I knew and an attempt to make him stop. I told my sister (then 18F now 39F) about it cause I was really upset but that was it. \n\nThe next time I went on the computer my entire music collection had been deleted from my account as well as my downloading program had been uninstalled. I was pretty annoyed and I complained to my dad about it at dinner in front of my mum he got angry and was like WELL LOTS OF THINGS HAVE BEEN DISAPPEARING OFF THE COMPUTER RECENTLY HAVENT THEY?? I was so shocked by his reaction considering what his missing stuff was and I was a young girl it seemed audacious, I nearly said what is was to my mum but I was just too afraid.\n\nI decided to just leave it and try and try to forget about it. I told myself that at least it wasn't real porn with it in just these cgi cartoony things that don't have proper genitals. He changed his password and I never saw the new one.\n\nAfter catching him today and seeing all his porn choices in the history, I feel sick thinking he has been doing this this whole time since back then?\n\nI just don't know what to think or do. I don't know what to make of it. It doesn't seem like he wants to have sex with dogs himself but just see women with them. Is this a degradation thing? Is this messed up? Is he a secret pervert? Is this misogyny? Fetishism? \n\nI've been trying to look up help online but I only really seem to find stuff about people wanting/having sex with animals themselves - if he was into that would he not watch men have sex with dogs to imagine it is him? \n\nOther than this my dad is really great, he was an architect and is still an artist. He was a fun and warm and playful dad when I was young, he used to drive me to sports clubs all the time. He also warm and fun with my sisters kids now who love him the most out of everyone. I've never heard him say  anything thats made me think he is misogynistic or sexist. He is however very disorganized. My mother has always worked full time as well and she basically has to look after him to keep order. My mother is pretty emotional and can have bad mood swings and get shouty and she organises my dad but also has a go at him about it a lot and she is very dominating and can be belittling of others when she is mad.\n\nI thought when I was young maybe it was some sort of reaction to feeling demasculated (?) by my mum or something. I just wanted to forget cause aside from that I get on with him more than my mum and havent had issues with him, I also havent seen him angry like he was that day at dinner and even today it was unlike him to lash out at me about not helping my mum. \n\nI just don't know what to do. I think if my mum knew she would really go insane and probably chuck him out the house. I think she would be really hurt, it's messed my head up (although I saw it all) and I'm not married to him. They are in there 70s now and have been married nearly 50 years. \n\nI told my sister again and she said she thinks we should confront him but I just don't even know what to say. His previous reactions bother me also. She thinks we should try and get him to get help. She agreed she thinks my mum would be incredibly upset if she knew and it could be life ruining for her and thinks we should avoid telling her.\n\nI said maybe we could seek a professional therapist who specializes in this sort of thing and have a session and ask for advice from them on what to do before confronting him. But as I said I couldn't find anything I felt was appropriate so far, does anyone know of anyone/where for me to look for this issue?\n\nI'm also concerned because I know the possession of bestiality porn is illegal here in UK but I don't know about streaming it. He doesn't use a VPN or even an incognito window as I found the history in his browser. Could he get in trouble?\n\nI just feel physically sick and anxious about it. I wonder what else he might be doing.\n\nAm I over-reacting?\n\nPlease be gentle I've never actually posted on reddit before, I feel too embarrassed to ask friends for help. \n\nThanks in advance",

Robby's in his senior year of high school and he's honestly always been a good kid. I love that little brat.\n\nHowever, a few nights ago, I was in the middle of watching cobra kai while Brian was at work. I get a frantic call from Robby. I'll spare the details but he said that he had no money and was in emergency need of Plan B for his girlfriend (F18). He begged me not to tell his parents, and I agreed to it. It's worth noting that he doesn't have a car just yet, and apparently neither does his girlfriend. The kid was freaking out and screaming on the phone, so I took some time to calm him down and reassure him that his future was not ruined and everything was going to be okay.\n\nI went to the nearby CVS and even bought two Plan Bs in case this happens again in the future, and drove down to Robby. My sister and BIL were out for the night, and Robby couldn't thank me enough. I told him not to mention it and also advised him to stay careful in the future. Robby begged me to keep this between us, and I agreed to spare him embarrassment. Unfortunately, I got an angry call from Lisa the next morning, and she had found the other Plan B in Robby's bathroom drawer while she was cleaning the bathroom. She said it was out of line for me to go and do that behind her back, and that I should've told her and Harold. I said that Brian was freaking out and I didn't want to embarrass him or make him feel bad, but Lisa said I was an AH for interfering with her parenting, and that me \"advising him to stay careful in the future\" was an inappropriate thing to say to my own nephew. It's literally gotten to a point where Harold and even a couple of Lisa's friends have been messaging me. I haven't even told Brian about this to keep Robby's word. I wasn't judging him at all, I really was just trying to help.\n\nSince then, I've still been getting messages from Lisa, Harold, and their friends. I haven't responded to a single one, and I even posted to AITA about this before it got taken down. I got a lot of advice on giving Robby the talk, but I'm extremely worried about how inappropriate that's just going to look. But at the same time, I fear that Robby might be uneducated on this stuff, as Lisa and Harold have honestly always been weird about this. Where do I go from here?",

I also sometimes go to less than safe places where theft can be an issue. I also cook and often have my hands in foods that may be acidic etc. Finally, I lose things all the time! So I'm ordering a silicone band to wear when I'm not comfortable wearing my wedding ring. Mainly in the situations I just listed.\n\nMy fiance seems to think this is weird. Every time I bring it up he asks me why I wouldn't just wear my ring. I've explained all of the above.\n\nAm I missing something here? Maybe I'm not being empathetic. Any advice as to how I should look at this?",

I ask what it is and, it's bleach. I express how much I didn't want that and that and how dare they just put it on my hair without telling me even after it was agreed that bleach wouldnt be used etc. They're like, \"oh you'll be fine\" and then proceeded to dye my hair a second time after the bleach. I look like a clown now with different colors on my hair (orange at the root and brownish red at the body).

I have curly hair so my curls will most likely not be the same also. \n\nI wanted a refund for this experience. These stylist did whatever they wanted to me.

Use a deep conditioning treatment if it seems damaged, gradually trim the ends rather than just cutting it all, there is no reason you should have to lose your length and your money. You could take it to small claims but I feel in the long run it would be worth more of your energy than it's worth. If it is a corporation call and make a complaint on the salon specifically those ladies, we don't need people like that in the industry, they can have their license revoked. I know a lot of people are against doing their hair at home, but I personally do because of an experience similar to this, and I did attend cosmetology school.  Your roots are much lighter because they take bleach the fastest. Go to Sally's get a toner and developer of your shade choice  I would recommend like a burgundy shade a little darker than the ends of your hair and just do the roots, it will give you a nice ombre affect.

        "Question": "I Think My Husband Could Be Plotting To Kill Me\nTL;DR Discovered my husband has for a while been telling people I'm suicidal, and am generally mentally unstable. It's occured to me this could be part of an attempt to make it look like I commited suicide if I were to die suddenly. Am I being paranoid?\n\nI (26f) Have recently found reason to suggest my husband (29M) could be plotting to kill me and make it look like a suicide.\n\nYes, I realise how out there that sound, let me explain-\n\nMy reason for thinking is is because I discovered he has been secretly telling people we know, for a while, that I am apparently suicidal, along with other things to make me seem mentally unstable, as far as lying about having to call the police because I was a missing person. Recently the thought came to my mind, that this could be a way of making my death appear like a suicide, if he were to kill me, and I wanna share those thoughts to see what others think \n\nIt started after he one night told me not to go into the local store he works at, as he left early and had apparently used me as an excuse. Then not long after he happened to leave his messages open, and I noticed a conversation with his coworker about me, so curiosity got the better and I took a snoop. Turns out the excuse he'd used about me, was claiming that I'd gone missing and he needed to go look for me, adding the detail that I'm 'on suicide watch' even saying that he called the police. \n   \nOn another occasion, he said we can no longer go to his shop on Thursdays (It's the local store so we shop there regularly) because he'd told them he needed that day off as he takes me to therapy that day (This isn't true, we've never been to therapy)  \n\nMore recently we had similar incident, where he told me I couldn't go in the his shop as he'd used me as an excuse again. I Took another snoop and found he'd told them he needed to stay home with me due to my mental health. When he finally went back he told them that my brother is able to be with me now so he feels safe leaving me at home (I Haven't spoken to my brother in months)\n\nTo be clear, I have no history of mental health issues, never had to go to therapy, never been a missing person, nor has anyone ever had to call the police for me\n\nThis all also reminded me of a time a while ago, where he mentioned in casual conversation how he could get away with killing me, because no one would notice me missing. He explained how I don't talk to my friends or family regularly so they wouldn't realise I was gone, and he could just call my work and tell them I quit. This did creep me out at the time, but I brushed it off as a weird joke\n\nFor background, my husband is diagnosed with autism,  ADHD, and narcissistic personality disorder, he also has always had compulsive lying and anger issue. (I've Know of that since even before this) He also has a history of mistreating me, in a way some might call abusive. A lot of emotional abuse such as putting me down, both privately and in front of other,  being demanding and controling. He's never actually struck me physically, but has used threats of violence to get what he wants before\n\nAlthough all this concerns me, I also feel kinda silly for being concerned. Maybe I'm just paranoid, maybe I actually am as crazy as he's making me out to be? An outside perspective would be helpful.\n\nShould I do anything, or just ignore it and stop snooping?\n\nEDIT: Apologies for the way I've been replying to comments so far, I realise I've been acting kinda stubborn and it isn't helpful. I'm Gonna pause reading the comments for a bit so I can come back with a more clear head. Please do continue commenting if you have anything though as I will read them]",

I just would like to get to know her and her to know me. I don\u2019t want to mess this up, or make it boring and her not want to come back. I want to be the dad she deserves. Advice?",

Even if you can't cook and make only simple things, do you know how to make an ice cream sundae or make tacos together or make your own personal pizzas or nachos? Something where you get a chance to do an activity together. \n\n2. Go to Walmart (go with her) and pick out some arts and crafts supplies and draw pictures together. Even if you aren't good at art, doesn't matter, what matters is doing something together, maybe she takes your picture home and you keep hers. Or there are like craft kits for making little window/mirror decorations, just scrolling online there's like a paint your own unicorn, you could even give her a little sketchbook to draw in. Just stay away from things with small parts and beads and such. \n\n3. Does she have a designated place to sleep for her? Maybe you two can go pick out a blanket together that she keeps at your place, or stuffed animal, or pillow etc. Something that's hers for her sleeping spot to feel more comfortable. (sorry I'm thinking of a lot of purchasing ideas). \n\n4. Watch some movies together. Maybe some movies you liked as a kid if you have a streaming service that she hasn't seen before. Hell watch some star wars and make lightsabers out of cardboard boxes and such. \n\n5. If there's time when she visits and one near by, take her to the aquarium. They're excellent places. Also much better than the zoo. Maybe you go to the aquarium and afterwards you both draw your favorite fish that you saw while eating dinner? Or maybe you get her a little portable camera to take photos, or you let her take photos of the fish with your phone? \n\nProbably not the best ideas but hopefully inspire some other ones for you. Again congratulations on the progress in your life and good luck.",

I am in the planning committee and help with all the school events. I stay after-school for two hours on Mondays and Tuesdays to help one of my teachers (i help with things like organizing, printing papers, small things like that) My mom (35F) is asking me to contribute $50 to help with bills. I get paid $500 every two weeks. I do want to contribute, but I don\u2019t know if nows the right time to. Should I contribute? Or should I tell her no and wait until I get a higher paying job when I\u2019m older.\n\nEdit: Hello, I just woke up. Thank you for all the advice. Yesterday I asked my mom what the $50 was for and she said it was for if we ever needed it. We buy food (mostly on weekends) if there\u2019s nothing at home and she said the money will go towards that or just anything that needs to be paid for. I realize now that I might have been a little misleading because I cannot confirm that I actually make $500. The coordinator of the program I\u2019m in said we make $500 every two weeks, but I get my first check on Friday. I also said I was an intern, sorry about that I just checked my timesheet and it says im a teacher aide.",

We had been together for about 9 months before i found out that he had been cheating on me with a 20F, lets call her Karen, for the last two months. I broke it off after finding out. Within a week she moved into his place (her parents kicked her out). It has been 3 months and he told me he regrets it and he chose the wrong girl. He asked me what it would take for us to get back together. I said to stop sleeping with karen and have her move out would be a start. She moves out within two days. He says karen is moving to a different branch of the franchise they work for so he also wont have to see here there, but they are in a soccer league together that meets once a week for the next 5 weeks. I asked him to block karen and go no contact with her. He says no because they are still friends and he doesn\u2019t plan on seeing her romantically (also that he doesn\u2019t want to be told what to do and i should trust him). \n\nAITA for wanting him to not talk to her? How can the trust be rebuilt? I\u2019m not sure if i should move forward with getting back together.

        "Aswer": "It\u2019s a very personal choice that no one here can make for you. But if you\u2019re asking strangers then you may either feel pressured (directly or indirectly) by your friends or you are slightly interested but nervous. It\u2019s not a hard drug - you won\u2019t get physically or mentally hooked after a couple of hits. But it can be habit forming and many people get sucked into it that way.\n\nWe\u2019ll speak only recreationally because medical is a whole other topic. First, I\u2019d personally recommend not smoking before 25. I\u2019m not sure how old you are but I have many friends who smoked in high school and \u2018claim\u2019 negative side effects like bad memory loss etc. it\u2019s better to wait for your brain to fully develop. \n\nIf you do want to try it, start small. Don\u2019t get pressured into doing more than your comfortable and give yourself some time to feel the effects before continuing. I usually find with smoking that 10-20 minutes after the hit I can feel it. Edibles are different and can take 30 minutes to 1.5+ hours.\n\nDifferent types of weed have different effects. You may not like what you smoke, but it could be the strain. You can always try another one later.\n\nYou may get paranoid. Just remember that it won\u2019t kill you and take deep breaths. Be close to people you trust who can help keep you relaxed. A good environment means a good high.\n\nWeed can be a good way to relax and hang out with friends - like drinking can - but it can also help distress from a long day. Do what feels right for you but if you find yourself smoking from morning until night, or you feel a compulsion to smoke before every meal, consider taking a break.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: updated age to 25 per many recommendations. Personally I started at 20 as many do in college but I\u2019m sure medically the recommendation is 25. If it\u2019s occasional and small amounts I don\u2019t think there\u2019s significant side effects.\n\nEdit 2: as always anyone who is neurodivergent or has a mental illness should always be cautious about using substances. If you see a therapist or psychiatrist and feel comfortable with them try to be honest about your usage. It\u2019ll help them help you and may impact what medications they recommend.",

For the past few weeks, I've noticed that food in my house has been disappearing without any explanation. At first, I thought I was just forgetful and had eaten it myself, but I've started keeping track and now I'm sure that something else is going on.\n\nThe food that's been disappearing is usually things like snacks, fruits, and other small items that can be easily grabbed and eaten. It's never anything substantial like a full meal, but it's enough to be noticeable. I live alone, so it's not like anyone else is eating it without my knowledge and there aren't any extra wrappers or peels in any of my trash cans or bags.\n\nI've checked my apartment for any signs of a break-in, but everything seems to be in order.

They\u2019re my world and honestly I\u2019ve been beating myself up even having these thoughts but recently I\u2019ve doubted if she\u2019s really my biological daughter. We have similarities but there are certain things that have me second guessing. My wife and I both have green eyes I\u2019m mixed and she\u2019s Italian and American. My baby has brown eyes I know it\u2019s a possible for two green eyed parents to have a brown eyed baby but I\u2019ve read it\u2019s rare. \n\nA few years back I had to travel for work and I had my suspicions of my wife cheating but the thought alone brought me to tears. I discussed it with her and she assured me she was loyal to me. She has cheated in her previous relationship but I didn\u2019t want to judge based on that because she was in high school and we\u2019ve all done dumb shit we regret as kids. \n\nI have discussed my concerns with her and to say I caused an argument would be an understatement. She got extremely upset and asked me how I could insinuate that she would ever cheat on me or that my baby isn\u2019t mine. I\u2019ve spoken to her in the past ab my doubts and she told me she would never cheat. I brought it up again and said I had my doubts but I\u2019ll drop it and apologized. She got very defensive and started crying saying \u201cI guess you want a paternity test since you don\u2019t believe me\u201d. I said no but after speaking with my family about it I think I may want one just to clear my mind. If she\u2019s mine I\u2019ll hate myself for ever being doubtful but if she\u2019s not I still haven\u2019t thought about the consequences that can bring. She is my daughter and I love her no matter what but what will that do to my marriage. \n\nThis has caused me so much internal conflict and I\u2019ve spent nights crying thinking I could be making the biggest mistake of my life.

Take 3 steps back!\n\nI understand your doubts, the might be valid but when focusing on just eye color you have about a 25% change of that happening (a lot of other factors come in but it's a ballpark) that's the same as flipping heads twice in a row... Happens all the time!\n\nFirst: Before you do anything decide what you would do if the child isn't yours. Are you actually leaving? Or would you stay regardless?\n\nThere was a story on Reddit lately from a MIL that did the testing for the couple and it broke the guys heart because it was a SA baby and he really didn't want to know so he could keep pretending it was his. \n\nIf you stay regardless I can imagine it being worse if you would know she isn't yours. \n\nLeaving would be a valid choice, let's get that clear. However you need to decide before you do the test what the results will mean for you, because knowing may hurt you more than not knowing.\n\nSecond: get couples counseling, recently heard a story where after a good talk through a therapist both partners were on the same page (and got the test). Where your feelings are valid so are your wife's feelings. And finding a middle ground while both coming from a place of hurt is (almost) impossible. \n\nThird: if you really can't live without knowing and you can't find middle ground on this test, your relationship is already over. You will either resent yourself for not pushing, your partner for not agreeing or she will resent you for doing it anyway. Resentment is a top indicator (iirc even the number 1 indicator) for a failing relationship. Realize NOW if you really need that resentment in your life (in whatever shape) and act accordingly. \n\nBut, if you are ending the relationship anyway, might as well get the test through a court before paying child support.",

        "Question": "I slept with my female friend even though I am gay. I don't know what else to do.\nI don't know where to start. It is a massive fuck up from my part. For starters, I (30M) was in a relationship with my boyfriend John (30M) for 7 years. I found out he was having an affair with a married man (34M). I got to know because that married man's wife, Kelly (32F) showed up to my place to talk to my boyfriend but he wasn't there at that time. That's when she informed me that my boyfriend and her husband has been having an affair for 3 years. The woman just cried in front of me. And we both confronted each other's significant others. I broke up with John and Kelly got a divorce. Over the last 3 years Kelly and I have started to talk. At first she approached me by saying a lot of her family and friends are against her because she is not happy with her husband coming out and even calling her homophobic. I explained to her that she wasn't homophobic. It is justifiable for her to feel hurt over this. \n\nShe is a nice and kind woman. I liked her. I liked spending time with her. Her friends have also became my friends. She and I helped each other through our tough times. Over the last 3 years we have been in and out of relationships with other people. Last night she called me and said she is alone because that day was her anniversary. I asked her if she needed me to be there, she told me yes if I don't mind. I went there. We were lying on her bed and kinda tipsy from all the alcohol. We were talking and she said how much she feels alone and humiliated by her ex-husband. I said I understand. Then she snuggled closer to me and kissed me. She immediately stopped and said sorry multiple times. I just brushed it off and said it's fine we are just tipsy. The next time I kissed her and one thing led to another we had sex. And it was not like I hated it or repulsed by her. In fact we did it 2 more times before falling asleep. The next morning we talked. She says that she understands that I am going through some stuff and said sorry if I ever felt forced. I told her no, it was consented. I left her place. I don't know what happened to me. I knew I was gay since I was 18. But I did like sleeping with her. I don't know. Maybe I need to rethink my life choices. Is this something normal?",

But from the point where I made the comment she\u2019s been very cold and threatening our marriage saying I better not get the test done behind her back and she also would not allow it to happen at all. I read comments from a lot of women saying they\u2019d be pissed too either way if the test positive or negative from mistrust, so I thought that was the case. We did have a long conversation this morning. She looked through my phone last night and found the post. That\u2019s what sparked the conversation again. She said she was hurt I would keep bringing this up and I should trust her and leave my insecurities behind. \n\nIt was long conversation, a lot of tears and words were said. I offered marriage counseling and dropped the topic of the dna test. She refused and said it\u2019s ridiculous and doesn\u2019t want to involve anyone else in our marriage. \n\nI read a lot of comments and stories saying sometimes the guilt will get to them and they\u2019ll just confess without needing to do a test\u2026 I didn\u2019t think that would happen in my case but it did. She told me that she didn\u2019t want this to happen but she did cheat on me and my daughter is not mine. She said she wanted me to be the father and loved me and thought this would be her best option. She didn\u2019t want me to take a test and find out on my own which I wish she would\u2019ve come clean way before. I didn\u2019t know how to respond but asked who the father was because my mind already is making a million assumptions. She didn\u2019t tell me and began crying more telling me to not hate her and not end the marriage. I didn\u2019t say anything again waiting for an answer. This happened early this morning and I didn\u2019t an answer until this afternoon. \n\nI had to leave for work this morning so when I came back she had calmed down a bit and was ready to tell me. Her answer was probably the last thing I was expecting. She cried while saying this but said a few years back when I went on a business trip, she slept with my father who she \u201cran into on a drunk night\u201d I don\u2019t believe it. My father passed away in December from a colon cancer when he was 45. He did meet my daughter, half sister, his daughter idk.. but never said anything clearly. She said they both decided it was a dumb mistake (a major understatement) and it\u2019d be best to erase it and play me as being the father. Me and my father never had the best relationship I grew up with my single mom but he was present in my life and when he passed it hurt my family a  lot. So hearing this broke me. I am currently staying with my brother. I haven\u2019t spoken about what I\u2019ve learned with anyone even him. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve fully processed so coming here to write this felt like a good place to get my thoughts out. \n\nI didn\u2019t say anything after she told me that and just left after she finished explaining. I don\u2019t know where I even go from here. I don\u2019t want to abandon my child while she\u2019s technically my half sister but do need time to process this. I don\u2019t think any amount of marriage therapy will fix this so divorce is my next step. I am going to seek a therapist for myself and help myself so I can be there for my daughter.",

Things have been rough for us both personally, but our relationship has been good together for the most part.\n\nToday, out of the blue, I woke up to a long message about how she doesn't like me following other girls on Instagram (mind you, these are girls I've met once or twice either at EDM festivals, just out and about, struck up a conversation once or twice and or mutuals. I've never had anything romantic with them and I have no intentions on hitting them up/cheating on my girlfriend.). This was a recurring topic for a while that died down for a very long time, but just came up again. I told her I never talk to these girls online really, and I never check their pages, their feeds, etc and that there's nothing to worry about. I'm hardly even much of a media person outside of YouTube. I know she has problems with guys following models, but I don't do that. So I said that I don't want her to be controlling towards me because I'm never that way with her, and I'm not okay with her if she gives me this ultimatum when I've done so much for her to try to ease her anxiety and prove to her that I love her. (BTW she is posted on my Instagram so other girls would know I have a girlfriend anyway)\n\nShe says that me being reluctant to unfollow them shows I value them more than I value my relationship with her and that me following other girls gives her the ick. But for me, it's not about her telling me to unfollow specific people -- for me, it's about upholding my standards and establishing what trust means and not letting other people tell me how to manage my social media, etc. I have no problem unfollowing these people, but I think it points to larger red flags if she feels this way simply about me following these girls I don't interact with at all.\n\nAm I in the wrong for not unfollowing these girls I don't interact with on Insta because my girlfriend wants me to?

        "Question": "UPDATE: A delusional teenager I work with is telling people we're dating\nFirst of all, thank you for everyone who commented and gave me advice. I wrote a small update in my [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/Advice/comments/11tqyw2/a_delusional_teenager_i_work_with_is_telling/) about talking to a lawyer friend. I brought this up to a different manager, mentioning new information that I found out (he was showing people a porn video he found of a girl who looks somewhat like me sucking dick and told people it was me) ANNNND... Nothing. Not. A. Thing. He \"apologized\" saying he didn't want it to go this far and the mangers told us to keep it out of the building. No change of schedule, no consequences, NOTHING. So I'm gonna be going to HR and looking for a new job because this is ABSOLUTE bullshit. I feel disgusted with this place's actions regarding this.\n\nAdditionally, I've contacted his school and requested that they notify his parents because I couldn't find a way to contact them, and at the least if a teacher hears about this there's a paper trail showing I tried to notify them about this little fucker's actions. I'm also lucky enough that he only works weekends and I can see the days he works and try to pick up shifts to avoid him as much as humanly possible. But that's all I have for now. If he comes anywhere near me in the future or if I hear anything else I'm gonna lose my shit, and I'm gonna try and burn this restaurant to the ground. If y'all have any other advice I'm very open to it though! Thanks again guys",

He was the first person I dated. I absolutely adored him. He was the love of my life, my best friend, my life partner. It's sad to say, but I thought he would be the last person on earth to cheat. But here we are.  \n\nI've had so much issues with my mental health since finding out about the affair. I feel so naive. I trusted this man 100 percent. He always portrayed himself as someone with a high moral compass. I remember him expressing how much disdain he has for people who cheat. I did sense something off about him and this girl. I confronted him about it and he managed to look me in the eye and deny everything. He looked me in the fucking eye and told me he loved me and only me. That he would never cheat on me. Only for me to catch him a week after. And then subsequently, leaving me for his affair partner. I just can't imagine trusting anyone again. \n\nFor people who have gone through the same situation, how did you recover?",

In conversation, my boyfriend nonchalantly brought up that his friend (m29) had sent him and his other friends videos of his girlfriend performing oral sex on him through snapchat. I asked if this was consensual and he said no, probably not. I flipped out and said this is a crime and so deplorable etc. and my boyfriend was like \"I didn't expect you to react like this.\" I told him that I couldn't date him if he thinks that's okay and he said that he didn't think it was okay but it wasn't his place to say something since it happened 5 years ago. My boyfriend doesn't want to give up his friendship with this person saying that he's been there for him through some tough times and everyone makes mistakes. To me, this is not a mistake, this is a CRIME. Not to mention he did it multiple times. I'm disappointed in my boyfriend for not saying anything and continuing to be this disgusting man's friend. Not to mention, the guy is still dating this girl and she most likely has no idea! I care about my boyfriend so much but I didn't expect something like this from him at all.\n\nAm I overreacting or am I right? I want my boyfriend to stop being friends with him or at least call him out on it, even if it happened years ago. Would this be a justifiable reason to break up with someone even though he wasn't the one who did it?",

        "Question": "Found out my SIL is a possible groomer and my family wants to sweep it under the rug and act like everything is normal\nTLDR: Recently found out my SIL didn\u2019t quit from her school/coaching position for the reason I was told and the real reason is that she was caught messaging a minor that she was coaching and my family wants to pretend it all didn\u2019t happen.\n\nBackstory: months ago my SIL quit her teaching position at a small town school because the stress of it all was destroying her mental health, so she quit but quickly got a new job teaching at another school. SIL was also a coach for a high school team at the first school and is now looking at tying to be a coach again at the new school. \n\nProblem is all of this was a lie.\n\nThe real story is that she \u201cquit\u201d (told to quit or else they would fire her and put it on her record) because she was caught inappropriately messaging a boy on her team. My brother caught her the first time and told her to stop or he\u2019d leave her and tell the school, well she didn\u2019t quit and the school found out on their own.\n\nThing is though that she got another teaching position really soon after losing the first job and even after my brother told her not to, she is pursuing getting another coaching position at the new school. \n\nI\u2019m being kept in the dark as to what was contained in the messages to/from the minor other than being told it was \u201cinappropriate\u201d, but my position is that a coach who is messaging a student at all hours of the night and whose relationship has cause a minor to have to start counseling is a predator, as she either groomed him or was attempting to. And while our family agrees that this behavior is predatory, they are more concerned about whether or not my brother will divorce her and are encouraging marriage counseling.\n\nI feel like I\u2019m going insane here and I\u2019m the only one taking this seriously, like yes it\u2019s sad and unfortunate that my brother may lose his wife, but how are we not addressing that she GROOMED A CHILD and seems to be putting herself in the position to do it again.\n\nI just got off the phone with my mother and asked what the hell I\u2019m supposed to do as Easter where our family will all get together is coming up, am I just supposed to treat her like nothing happened?!\n\nHer answer: yes\n\nAs a survivor of child sexual abuse, I\u2019m not only offended that she\u2019s being invited, but I\u2019m pissed that it\u2019s expected of me to treat her like she didn\u2019t 1) attempt to cheat on my brother 2) attempt to cheat with a MINOR\n\nDoes anyone have any advice? I don\u2019t know what to do, I\u2019m considering not going to our typical family Easter because I don\u2019t know if I can treat her normally and frankly I don\u2019t want to. She has faced zero consequences for her actions, my brother stayed with her and she got a good job after she \u201cquit\u201d. Do I call the new school and tell them to ask around for what really happened at her old job?\n\nI\u2019m sorry if this is all a mess to read, as I\u2019m quite flustered after all this information was dumped on me and I seem to be the only one concerned about her actions and not about the status of their marriage.

She met a girl in a party, they had a making out session and she really enjoyed it. She's gay but that's the first girl she ever hooked up with. Since then they've been sharing some spicy texting and plan to hook up again. The problem is, the girl is 12.\n\nI already told her she should find someone a bit older, maybe 15, and to please stop talking to that girl and not hook up with her. But she's been walking around with some bad influences who told her it's okay, it's not a big deal, that girl hooked up with someone who's 20 before (needless to say they do similar stuff and make out with people much younger and much older). \n\nI don't know what to do.

She\u2019s helped me tremendously over the years through several big life situations. However, several red flags have come up that I just can\u2019t shake and I think I need to part ways: \n\n1) I fall in the middle of the road (but leaning more towards caution) with COVID. I got my shot, I masked when masking was required and followed the guidelines. She is very anti-vax and makes it clear that she doesn\u2019t believe COVID is a big deal. Regardless where anyone falls on the Covid scale, her being so vocal to me about her thoughts somewhat pushed me to alter what I would talk to her about, if it involved something Covid-related. \n\n2) I was taking to her about someone who I have some conflict with. She asked me if they are \u201cre***ded\u201d. Not in a way of thinking they really could have Down syndrome, but in a derogatory way. I am passionate against using that word. \n\n3) Last session, when I showed up, I was outside because a fire alarm went off. Once it was all clear, my therapist and I went inside and she said she was \u201cliterally saved by the bell because she was having to listen to a client who goes on and on - and won\u2019t stop talking.\u201d It put me off that she\u2019s down talking a client of hers. \n\nI\u2019m a bit of a baby when it comes to conflict and would love some advice on how to stop seeing her, in a way that is not massively stressful.",

She essentially worked out in therapy that she's always loved the idea of me, but doesn't know to what extend she actually loves me. \n\nShe has a lot of unresolved youth trauma and never had counseling. She's always \"latched on\" from bf to bf before we got together, which according to her psychiatrist is because of the feeling of not having to go at it alone - something she's had to do all her life as her parents were.. preoccupied. I practically had to force her into therapy.\n\nLast week I've been told she's trying to work out where she stands, because living like this has gotten her numbed off and desperate. She's getting anti-depressants today, and confessed that she just wants to be alone right now. She went as far as preparing me that depending on how the next few months go for her in terms of developing a sense of self, we might not be married anymore by (what would've been) our first anniversary. If she realized she does not love me like that after all, she might decide it's too hard to leave anyway. I just don't see a way where you don't known if you love someone you married 4 months ago, but after a few bouts of therapy you realize you do..\n\nI realize I played a big part in this because she's always had issues expressing herself and I figured it'd get better with time. I guess this is her expressing herself, just not the way I imagined it would go. There are so many questions I can't even begin to ask her, because she doesn't know the answers for herself let alone how to convey them to me. My world's just been shattered, and I'm supposed to keep truckin' on like nothing happened. I can't get any work done, I have a constant feeling of dread pitting in my stomach and I just want to shut down. My boss has been so kind to allow me to WFH for a few days to gather myself, but as I can't focus I'm afraid they'll think I'm just loafing around.\n\nWhat hurts me the most is thinking about our weddingday, when I was bawling my eyes out on for the love of my life and she just went through the motions because that was what was expected of her..\n\nI'm expected to give her space, but all I want to do is crawl in bed next to her and cuddle all day. But the tighter I grip the harder the pulls away. Am I just looking away from the inevitable? I feel like this is the beginning of the end.. How do I get anything productive out of my hands ?

Now my mothers mad at me for supposedly ruining her life.\n\nHello everyone my name is Ella I\u2019m 15 years old. My parents are divorced and my father has primary custody and we are with my mother every other weekend. My twin sister Mia and I are extremely close and always have been. \n\nMia is gay and that\u2019s the main reason my stepfather has been mean to her ever since he met her but Saturday he crossed a line. I\u2019ve talked to my father about how my stepfather behaves towards my sister and he\u2019s had multiple conversations with my stepfather telling him to quit some of which have gotten very heated. Most of what he\u2019s been doing is calling her names and being very rude and disrespectful towards her. \n\nSaturday my sister had just gotten out of the shower she had gotten dressed walking out of the upstairs bathroom which is a few steps away from the top of the stairs. My mom and stepfather\u2019s bedroom right beside it. As my sister was walking out of the bathroom she had turned to walk down the stairs when my stepfather came out of the bedroom. He called her a homophobic slur then pushed her from behind and sent her falling down the stairs. \n\nI ran to check on my sister and aside from a broken arm and busted lip she was ok. I then called 911 and asked for the police and an ambulance. The police arrived first and I told them what had happened and they arrested my stepfather for aggravated battery. The ambulance arrived not long after to take my sister to the hospital. I rode in the ambulance with my sister and called our father who met us at the hospital. \n\nMy sister is ok they took X-rays and checked her for other injuries then put a cast on her arm that she\u2019ll get off in about two months. They kept her overnight for observation then sent her home the following morning. So she\u2019s going to be just fine. \n\nSince then my mother has been calling me nonstop and sending me text messages telling me that I ruined her life and should be ashamed for calling 911 and not giving her time to make up a story before taking my sister to the hospital. My father has called my mother and told her to knock it off and that she\u2019s lucky the police handled my stepfather and not him. It\u2019s safe to say that we won\u2019t be having to stay with my mother for awhile if ever and my sister and I both are happy about that.

I\u2019ve been so happy with her and I genuinely find a future with her. \n\nI was out on a work trip for a week and met this wonderful lady at the event. We spent some time together between our crew and theirs and had a couple nights out of drinking. Some sexual innuendos came from her to me, such as \u201cI\u2019d love to cuddle with you\u201d and \u201cif you roofied me I wouldn\u2019t mind\u201d. \n\nI don\u2019t know why but for some reason this turned me onto her but I was feeling uneasy about the situation too. On the last night her, my coworker, and I were in her hotel room talking for hours. After we left, she texted me and was asking if I was single. (Obviously hinting to hooking up). Never have I felt more tempted to get up, knock on her door, and spend the night. But I didn\u2019t, I told her about my relationship and she was very happy for me and understood my position.\n\nIt is now the next morning and I feel like I am regretting not getting up and going to her room. I don\u2019t know why, I\u2019ve never been in this situation before, no other woman has came onto me like that. I don\u2019t know how to feel now.\n\nDo I tell my girlfriend about my experience? Should I just keep it to myself? What should I do if I see her again?",

        "Question": "Boyfriend constantly not sure if he wants me\nLong story short:\n\nMe (26F) and my boyfriends (26M) were together for 2 years. Everything was ok the first 6 months. I fell into a horrible depression, that kind that makes not to be able to eat, sleep, stay alone. He was not supportive and cricitized me for taking medication and not doing things to get better. That was just a month or two. He also confessed that has thought about separation and couldnt stand the situation with me being depressed, because he was feeling ok and wanted someone that motivates him to be productive and do things. Also he left me alone after a panick attack at a doctor's appointment (I also had health issues, this being the main reason for my depression), because it was his lunch break and wanted to get back home to eat.\n\nFast forward I recovered quickly and forgave him. After 3 months he wanted again to separate because we had a routine and he didnt feel challanged by the relationship. We stayed together.\n\nFast forward again after 6 months he wanted again to separate and start telling that he doesnt know what he wants. He also said he wanted separation and after 5 min said he didnt. We stayed together.\n\nAgain fast forward 2 months I felt he  has changed behaviour and asked him if moving together was still on the table as we decided a month ago. He said no, I am not the girl he sees his future with and also he has seen his high school love with whom he had been in a \"relationship\" for 3 weeks and compared feelings and the ones for her were stronger. I broke up with him.\n\nHe begged me to stay, promised he will change, came to see me in the hospital, was extremely nice to me, said to move together. I forgave him.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks later(he was very nice and caring)  I made a joke that I want to eat meat again (we both dont eat meet). He said he wanted to break up, that he had these thoughts about not knowing what we wants again. After 5 min he regreted and wanted to stay together. I left.\n\nNow he tells me to forgive him that he loves me and doesnt know why he behaves like this and he is depressed.\n\n\nOpinions are welcomed:)",

Recently, my sister started dating this new guy who seemed nice at first, but he ended up disrespecting me in a way that I just can't let go.\n\nIt happened at a get-together my sister hosted at our parents' house. We were playing a game when he made a comment about how I was taking too long to make a move, and then he smirked and said, \"I guess that's what happens when you're not very smart.\" To be fair, my sister is way smarter than me and she's really great at these games too. But it was clear to me that he was trying to insult me, and I was taken aback.\n\nI didn't want to make a scene in front of everyone, so I tried to brush it off and continued with the game. But then he made another comment about how I must be bad at strategy games because I didn't go to college. That is not fair, I went to college but just not as good as my sister's. I was shocked and hurt. I couldn't believe he was being so blatantly insulting.\n\nAs the night went on, he made a few more snide remarks that were meant to put me down. It became clear to me that he was deliberately trying to provoke me. I tried my best to ignore him, but it was difficult to enjoy the evening after that.\n\nNow my sister wants to bring him to our family dinner next week, and I'm hesitant to let him come. I don't want to be around someone who doesn't respect me, and I feel like inviting him would just be condoning his behavior.\n\nMy sister thinks I'm being unreasonable and being too sensitive, and that I should give him a chance to make things right. But I just can't shake the feeling that I would be betraying myself if I let him come.\n\nMy parents want him to come too. It feels like I'm the only person who doesn't want him there. \n\nShould I be firm and ask her not to bring him, let her bring him and pretend nothing happened or not attend the dinner at all?\n\nEdit:\nTo clear up some confusion, I'm a female. My sister is 9 years older than me. I live with my parents. This is my sister's first serious boyfriend so she's acting a bit out of character. She's not usually like this. My sister took care of me growing up because both parents were busy working. I don't want to disrespect her because I see her as a mother and a role model.\nI just wanted you all to look at it from every perspective. Thank you for your kind comments so far as well.",

        "Question": "i created a fake account and found out my ex dumped me because i'm black\nI was having one of those nights where i was thinking of him again. I never understood why our relationship didn't work out, I felt there was a real reason that only he knew but didn't want to admit. My looks maybe? My personality, how clingy i got? However i am a terrible overthinker so i dismissed those type of thoughts, the silly thoughts that we have like \"it's because you're black\". Despite feeling left in the dark, i tried my best to make the relationship work, every effort made.\n\nBecause why would he date me in the first place if it was that? Why would we go out, why would he pay for our meals, we'd spend hours talking, have all these intimate moments, just for him to not actually want to pursue anything with me... due to my race?\n\nWell, girls, it is the exact reason. I created a fake account last night and started chatting him up. He confessed everything , to a stranger ! (Me using a fake account meant i was a stranger to him). In his words \"I would've kept dating her if she was white.\" My heart dropped when i read the message. He went on to say \" it's the fact that I'd never want a half black child\" ... I could only marry a white woman\". He's allowed his preferences i believe, but why string me along the whole time..?\n\nAnd so after moments of hurt, i tried healing myself, a little self reflection, trying to keep away flashbacks and tears. A little motivational reading, some looking at myself in the mirror and telling myself \"i am worth it!!\" However i'm starting to think, this is something i should get used to?\n\nI am feeling upset more than angry, i feel like a waste if that makes any sense, i feel stupid. I will never talk to him ever again, for sure. But part of me wants to hire a hitman. \n\nWas i ignorant to think that i could be successful in the dating realm, being the colour that i am? This is the reality for us girls ,right? Or could it be a geographical thing, maybe i'm not looking in the right places. Whatever the conclusion i don't know, i'm wondering if any other girls have been in this situation? Or if you have any advice, support to give? I'd appreciate it. Thanks, have a nice day all!",

It's unlikely that they will actually follow through with their threat to post the nudes online.

Contact your local police department and provide them with any information you have about the scammer.\r  \n\r  \nConsider contacting a lawyer. A lawyer can advise you on your legal options and help you take steps to protect yourself.\r  \n\r  \nSeek support from a trusted friend or family member.

On a few occasions his older cousin in her teens baby sat us when our parents went out or did events with our church. His cousin was also a member of our church and his family had a lot of prestige within our parish. \n\nWith that as the backdrop, when she would baby sit us she\u2019d let us play and do whatever. But after a while she would call us down to the family computer and porn would be one. She\u2019d have her hand in her pants and call us over. She\u2019d then have me and my friend do things to each other, to her, and she\u2019d do it back to us. It felt good to me but I knew it was wrong, even at 9 years old. She told us not to tell anyone or else our parents would get kicked out of the church. \n\nThis same pattern went on when I was well into my teens until we no longer needed a baby sitter. During puberty this was especially confusing because I didn\u2019t like men but was forced to do sex acts on my friend. Adding to that, i also lost my virginity to her and felt so impure. I didn\u2019t date anyone in HS because of this. I felt undeserving of love and confused about my sexuality. \n\nI experimented plenty when I went off to college and don\u2019t really have ties to the faith anymore. There is still a level of catholic guilt that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever escape but that\u2019s not all that present in my thoughts these days. The first girl I opened up to about my past left me because I was \u201cwith a man\u201d and I just don\u2019t know that I ever will be willing to be vulnerable like that again. \n\nI guess the reason for this post is to ask if anyone out there has had a similar experience and how you manage? I\u2019ve done therapy in the past but can\u2019t afford it at the moment. \n\nI also want to explore my sexuality further but have a lot of trust issues. Is there a place on Reddit to do so? The anonymity here provides me some comfort and this and r/sex sub was the first place I figured I should look.",

        "Question": "Is it irresponsible to hit a dab pen if you\u2019re the only one watching your kid but they\u2019re asleep?\nI thought it might help me relax, so I hit a dab pen that I keep safely put away in a box at the top of my closet where you\u2019re supposed to put hats. I rarely ever use it and it\u2019s been about 6 months since I hit it. Anyway, I wasn\u2019t expecting to get as high as I just got from one hit. Now I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s a small chance my daughter might wake up, and I don\u2019t know if this was an irresponsible move. I have everything around here taken care of, and I\u2019m not struggling to get by or provide, but yet getting high just now has made me question all of that and wonder if I\u2019m even fit to be a parent. \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m just high and it\u2019s actually not that irresponsible, because I\u2019m not impaired or unable to look after her if she wakes up, but I need a little bit of reassurance. My mom called a few minutes after I got high. Everyone always acts so concerned about me, and they always give me advice on what to do and check in on me, because they all think I\u2019m not cut out to be a single parent. None of my family or former in laws trust me at all. That\u2019s the only reason my mom called, and that made me start to wonder if maybe they\u2019re all right about me. I think this was a minor mistake, I didn\u2019t know I was going to get as high as I did, but I don\u2019t think this was irresponsible. Was this pretty bad and a sign that they\u2019re right, or not that big of a deal? If I wasn\u2019t high I would probably be able to know, but I can\u2019t work it out at the moment",

When we first started dating things were okay, but a couple months in, every time we would sleep over at eachothers place my face would break out in a crazy rash, my eyes would get super swollen and gunky, and I just looked and felt terrible. \n\nShe seemed slightly concerned at first. I told her that the only thing that has made this happen to me before is an ingredient in a lot of soaps and shampoos that I\u2019m allergic to. We looked through everything we own and use together and didn\u2019t find it in anything, except her shampoo. I told her that\u2019s probably what was causing it, since her hair would be near/on my face when we slept together. I asked her if she could possibly get new shampoo, and she said no.\n\nI asked her why not; she said that she really likes the way that shampoo feels and that she spent $100 on it (they\u2019re pretty big bottles). I told her I could give her some money to get new shampoo and she said no, she\u2019s not changing it. This conversation was 2 months ago. I try to bring it up every couple weeks, because my eyes and face have been red and swollen for months, but she kind of just laughs it off or changes the subject. It bugs me too because she always mentions \u201coh my god your eyes look so bad babe\u201d and I\u2019m just like\u2026 yeah, and we both know why? It\u2019s literally your soap.\n\nI\u2019m kind of at a loss, I understand that she likes the shampoo but it\u2019s physically affecting me negatively and I\u2019m getting kind of sick of people at work asking if I got beat up in a fight lol.

However, as a college student living away from family it is so difficult for multiple reasons. \n\nI am a gay male, with that comes completely being considered a sin in the muslim community or even within the religion, apparently. So, why would i be apart of a religion that doesn\u2019t accept me? I began to push myself away from the religion and now it\u2019s Ramadan. I cannot even explain that feeling of guilt thats just rooted within me because I don\u2019t want to partake in it. I have to lie to my parents and family in saying i am doing it, but im not. \n\nI was never given a choice in whether I wanna be religious or not anyways, I was simply just born into it. And that is so unfair and no one should EVER be born into a religion, it should be a choice. Anyways, after realizing and accepting myself in that I am not a straight male (and  because of that, my literal existence is a sin), and that i don\u2019t agree with most of the views in that religion, I dont wanna be apart of it. But, that feeling of guilt will always be with me, forever. Being told growing up that your parents will have to suffer if their kids are not religious, or following the religion is traumatizing. It sucks and it is so mentally draining.\n\nHow can i ease this feeling of guilt?",

You may not be able to celebrate Rahmadan with your family, but your college community may have you.

        "Question": "How should I deal with my nan discovering I have a tattoo?\nTo start this I am 18f and my nan is a big figure in my life. I see her almost weekly and she does so much for me and my family. She\u2019s currently watching me and my siblings for a month while my parents are on vacation. On to the problem. \nWhen I was 16 I got my first tattoo with parent permission. It\u2019s about the size of my fist and is a gorgeous floral design that I\u2019m absolutely in love with. My nan is very religious (Jehovahs witness) and very much against tattoos. I hadn\u2019t told my nan but she saw it yesterday while I was eating dinner. She called me out telling me how disappointed in me she was, how Im too young, how I am just \u201cfollowing the crowd\u201d, She called my heavily tattooed mother revolting and is now not speaking to me. I understand her point but I had been planning on getting a tattoo since I was like 10 and was set on my design for more then a year before I got it. I don\u2019t really know what to do and I\u2019m worried that things will never go back to normal. I\u2019m pretty anxious and just want some advice on how I should approach this topic.\n\n\nEdit: thanks everyone for your advice. I\u2019m going to talk about it on the drive to a friends house that I\u2019ll stay at for the night. Everyone has been really helpful thank you all so much. I\u2019ll update later on how it goes <3\n\n\nEdit 2.0: hi guys this is for anyone in case they were curious. I talked to my nan and told her that she doesn\u2019t have to respect my choices but she needs to respect me enough to not bring them up and some more. She\u2019s still upset that I got it but she knows that won\u2019t change anything. We are on proper speaking terms but now just to keep the piece I\u2019m making sure to keep the tat out of sight.

I work 7 days a week so that means I don\u2019t have time to spend any of the money I make so that basically means I save $900-$1,000 per week.

        "Question": "Should I cover my tattoo around my friend?\nI got a tattoo last December as a birthday gift, it's of a crow perched on a branch on my right upper arm, by my shoulder, and I'm so happy with it. A few days after I got it, I excitingly showed all my friends of it who all but one loved it. The one who didn't love it physically backed away while repeating \"no, that's not real\" like he was in a nightmare. He fathered me over it, telling me it was permanent. I showed my dad it and he was so happy for me and asked questions about it.\n\nFor reasons I won't go into, I usually wear baggy shirts with sleeves that hide my tattoo, it isn't because of the tattoo though.\n\nI recently saw that friend and I was wearing a shirt that slightly revealed the tattoo, he lifted my sleeve up and muttered \"still can't believe you have that\". I asked him why he's reacting like this and he said it's because he's against tattoos. I'd understand if this was his sibling or partner but not me.\n\nShould I cover up my tattoo to make him comfortable each time we meet up?\n\nETA - 1. Spelling mistake fixed. 2. Thank you for everyone who replied, I'm going to stick to what I wear because I love my tattoo",

        "Question": "Pregnant and need advice.\nHi. I am a 27f who is single and found out 3 days ago that I am pregnant by my long time on and off (34m). I have been in shock and reeling the last few days, because I was on birth control as well as took a plan b after we had sex the last time. We live about an hour away from each other, and he has a daughter who is about to turn 3. I didn\u2019t tell him for a couple days due to being in shock, I never saw my first pregnancy playing out this way and it\u2019s been a lot to process. We talked today and he says he thinks we should get an abortion because we don\u2019t live in the same city, he can\u2019t leave his current daughter, and job etc. i am having a really hard time making a decision. On one hand, I feel like I should get an abortion but that is something that would haunt me for the rest of my life, as I am not 17 anymore and am able to own up to my shit. It feels like a selfish decision at my age. I feel like if I keep it I should have him sign away his rights and do this completely on my own, I have a support system who loves me. I have never felt more alone, and I could really use some advice or just someone to tell me what to do.

Said so yourself; you aren\u2019t 17yrs old and have a support system. \n\nNext up: PREGNANCY IS NOT A PUNISHMENT FOR HAVING SEX. You said you can \u201cown up to your shit\u201d; this isn\u2019t really you causing a mess of shit in your life, though. You were on birth control (and Plan B), and it failed for whatever reason. It\u2019s an accident. It happens because that\u2019s generally what happens when people have sex; someone gets pregnant. \n\nAsk yourself: do you WANT to have a baby now? Fuck whatever sperm-donor over there says - especially the part about \u201cWE should get an abortion\u201d. HE faces no physical consequences of his ejaculation. YOU do, and if you choose to go that route, YOU will be having the abortion, not him. It\u2019s easy for him to go to this conclusion quickly because he\u2019s not the one facing the consequences of such a decision, you are. \n\nSo, circle back around: DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A BABY? You said you are financially able to support having a baby. You said you\u2019d have him sign away his rights (which does not mean he won\u2019t be paying child support, by the way; he\u2019s still financially on the hook for this), and handle things on your own. Ok, so you have the rest of the boxes checked, but do you WANT a baby? That\u2019s entirely up to you, and you\u2019ll get no judgement from me (pro-choice here, for the record).\n\nMy advice: take some time to really reflect on if you are really ready for a baby. See the doctor, and gather your inner circle for support. In most places, you have up to 24 weeks pregnant to obtain an abortion. \n\nGood luck to you.",

Well, her extended family is wealthy. Her parents are somewhere in the low 7 figures. But she never had to worry about money. Therefore she never really had a job. Sometimes she would work for her dad\u2019s company. But that would only be minor tasks. I never really worried about that because it was made clear she would take over the business and thought she\u2019d get everything together by then. At one point I got a bit annoyed that she was always at home and got her a job through a friend of mine where she works a few hours per week. \n\nI kind of became suspicious when she didn\u2019t finish her degree and confronted her about it. But she shrugged it off and told me it wasn\u2019t any of my business as long as she was able to pay rent and contribute financially to our life. Since communication is very important to me I was a bit alarmed. \n\nDuring the last year things got rocky. For reference: We split rent and costs for our dog 50/50. Since I\u2019m using her car sometimes I give her half of the leasing rate + gas. Other spendings are all from our own accounts.\n\nLast summer we went on a roadtrip where I payed for everything. Afterwards I told her the total, expecting her to pay me back. She told me she couldn\u2019t afford it, which I thought was weird. First of all because I know she got a huuuuge cheque from her dad the year before and I thought it was a bit unfair not to clarify beforehand. Since then she only payed rent sporadically. When I confronted her about it and asked her when she was gonna contribute again to our shared life I barely got an answer or she told me she couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not about the money but more about the way of not communicating about this issue.

        "Question": "Friend is mad because my husband complimented her?\nA good friend of mine broke up with her boyfriend of 6 years after she discovered he was cheating. She has recently decided to get back into dating, but she wanted the first date to be a double-date for her own comfort. Her date was completely on board and they invited my husband and I. We met at a restaurant. My husband and I arrived first, and my friend showed soon after. Before her date arrived, my husband made a comment to her:\n\n*\u201cThat dress looks eloquent (edit: ELEGANT) on you. The color is unique.\u201d*\n\nHere\u2019s the thing about my husband and his family: They give compliments. It\u2019s never sexual or over-the-top, but they all will **occasionally** give nice comments to people they know/trust, regardless of gender, and they do it sensibly, in my opinion. And it\u2019s not always about appearances. It\u2019s one of the things that attracts me to him. \n\nThe dinner went well, we thought. My friend\u2019s date seemed to hit it off with her. But the next day, my friend texted me this:\n\n*\u201cYou need to tell _____ to stop making comments about other women. That\u2019s how affairs start.\u201d*\n\nI told her I disagreed. She responded:\n\n*\u201cAs someone who was cheated on, trust me, I know. I can\u2019t believe you are okay with _____ looking at my dress. I was pissed off for you.\u201d*\n\nI told her that if she is uncomfortable with him complimenting her then she can tell him herself and that he\u2019ll respect her boundary/wishes. She replied with, *\u201c\ud83d\ude44 Don\u2019t come crying to me when you catch him with another woman. \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \ud83d\udea9 \u201d*\n\nI\u2019m at a complete loss for how to approach this.",

She's probably still reeling from the aftermath of being cheated on, herself... \n\nSuppose I'd say just tell your husband that she's not taking well to compliments from men right now, unfortunately, because she's still on edge from her prior relationship. I'd then see if it could become water under the bridge, but if she starts being nasty toward your husband, then that'd merit a more stern talk that she can't be treating people poorly like that.",

        "Question": "Wife cheated at the school she works in, with the janitor. What would you do?\nAs the title says, my wife of 14 years cheated on me with her schools janitor. His occupation has nothing to do with this, just that I am not naming him here.  \n\nI was devastated when I found out that this had happened. One, it happened within a couple days of meeting each other, two I learned of this relationship from my step son the day they were planning on getting a hotel room. My step son had happened to have her iPad, which gets the same messages her iPhone gets, when Janitor guy was sending duck pics to her. My step son is 14 and brought \u201cinappropriate\u201d texting to my attention, and when I saw what he saw I dove in and read everything they said to each other and every photo. I took photos of every text. 3 days is all it took to destroy 14 years. \n\nUpon further investigation she had lied about the day prior which would only have been day 2 where she said she was having to work late to complete a couple reports and a board. That day she had given the guy a hand job at the very least in the school library. I say at the very least because I can prove that with texts and what she confessed to in texts. This happened later in the day after kids have left, but it is an elementary school, middle school and high school all in one. They were in the elementary school if this matters. \n\nMy dilemma is , I am vengeful over this and can\u2019t let it go. We are getting a divorce, but this guy has been unharmed emotionally and physically. I feel I need to have him hurt to make up for my hurt and the hurt our 3 kids are going to go through because of this. This is also something I would say both of them need to stay out of places christen could be present doing this crap. After school activities happen there frequently. I am not sure if there was anything happening that day.\n\nAlso his dick has effected my step so. To the degree he runs from school at the bell and refuses to stay if he thinks he might encounter this man. He has caught his mom texting him still and has asked her to stop. He shouldn\u2019t have to deal with this. \n\nI want to turn him in for having sexual relations in a school. Or for adultery even. I can handle the fact this has happened and I need a divorce. I cannot handle the fact this will be part of the kids lives and my life and this guy gets to walk away. He needs to pay for this.\n\n*****Edit\nThank you all for the advise. I will be seeing a lawyer tomorrow to figure out what options I have. Revenge in any way would most likely cause me more issue. I\u2019m focusing on getting toxic thoughts out of my head and making sure the kids end up in the best possible situation. Which is the only part that scares the shit out of me.",

Your BF might have a bad way of going about it, but a level of social anxiety where you can't answer a call from a social worker will make your life very difficult going forward, and the cot of this kind of thing gets much higher as you get older. And the thing about a lot of anxieties is that they actually get better the more you're exposed to the thing that makes you anxious. We've constructed a socieity where it is actually feasible to live with very little uncontrolled/unwanted social contact, and people are more socially anxious than ever. So while your BF might be clumsy about it, his basic point is true.

        "Question": "My husband hides my toys!! HELP!\nLet me start by saying this man has an ego problem when it comes to our sex life. He is very inconsistent with everything, down to our finances. The first time, i was looking for my toy in my drawer, and it disappeared for over 3 months. I played along with it and then called him out on it when it reappeared. \n\nMost recently we moved and I put all the contents from the drawer into my bag. I've been looking for this bag for about 2 months  and I finally found the bag and my toys are missing. \n\nI'm so sick of his subtle controlling ways. He looks for ways to take away things I enjoy that intimidate him  but does nothing to actually fix our issues. I can't speak to anyone about this because it's so embarrassing. Should I try to have a real conversation about this?\n\nUPDATE!!!: I spoke to him about it, he didn't say anything at first then he started gaslighting me. Answering questions with questions then denied taking it. He did finally admit to hiding my last toy, stating, \"because he didn't want his step-son to get to it\" which is odd because he denied it for months! These rose toys are expensive, I'm mad I have to buy a new one. FYI - we did therapy in the past. After one session, he said the therapist should focus on her problems first. Would this be grounds for divorce for you?",

        "Question": "My parents want me (18) to go to jail for my sister (25)\nI don\u2019t know if the title is exactly accurate but it\u2019s closest to what\u2019s happening. And please don\u2019t think I\u2019m being over dramatic I\u2019m only sharing this incident because it\u2019s not too bad and can paint a picture. \n\nHi I\u2019m Jordan (18). Long story short I\u2019m the only \u201ccivilian\u201d (what my family calls me) in a family of people that have been in the street life at some point or another. I\u2019m confused on what to do and how to compromise. \n\nMy sister (25) recently got into a fight with this girl and when I was holding her accountable for her actions I was berated and told \u201cyou don\u2019t do that to family. It doesn\u2019t matter what happened, you should have her side no matter what\u201d. I was told I was wrong when removing myself from the situation incase a witness was needed, but then told not to tell 100% of the truth if it makes my sister look bad. \n\nI won\u2019t say exactly but through multiple situations my mom has shown me that she has no problem throwing me under the bus if it saves my sister. Which has me totally confused because I\u2019m being told that family should support each other but I\u2019m supposed to take the fall for my sister. I\u2019m supposed to lie for my sister. I\u2019m supposed to put myself in jeopardy to go to jail so that my sister can walk free. But why doesn\u2019t my family try to keep me out of that situation? Why would my family feel comfortable putting me in jail when I\u2019ve never did anything to have any run in with the police? I\u2019m told that I have a bad view of family and I should do better. My only concern is doing what\u2019s right. \n\nI\u2019ve been told by my parents that they\u2019re happy that I never got put into that kind of life but then I\u2019m almost belittled and berated for not being able to understand it. I\u2019m asked for my opinion but then yelled at and told \u201cyou\u2019ve never gone through it so you could never understand\u201c. I don\u2019t have the funds to move out because I\u2019m saving to start school. Do they not like me or something? What can I do?",

        "Question": "I was falsely accused of SA and it\u2019s ruining me\nI\u2019m 20 years old in college and a 30 yr old woman has tried to ruin my life, and it\u2019s worked to an extent. I met this woman through work, I thought she was nice, and she was at first. We talked often and became friends, she wanted it to evolve into something more and became infatuated with me and wanted sex, It wasn\u2019t reciprocated at alI. She showed up to my 2nd job (A grocery store) twice. I never told her where I worked. I was minding my own business working when she first showed up, I was walking to the front of the store to do some stuff and was shocked to see her, she lives 30 mins away from where I work so I didn\u2019t know why she was here at my store. She saw me see her and walked up to me and said \u201cHey! How are you? I\u2019m just on my break\u201d and i\u2019m thinking\u2026 why are you on your break here?? It was very awkward and I told her I was busy and needed to go so I left. The 2nd time she showed up, I had just clocked out and was getting ready to leave the store when I suddenly ran into her on my way out. She was \u201cshopping\u201d and was trying to strike up conversation. The first time was already weird af and I was beyond creeped out at this point. I told her I was busy again and needed to be on my way. One day when I wasn\u2019t working, I checked my snap map to see if she was there, she was. \n\nWhenever I\u2019d take a while to respond to her texts she would post on her snap story and make it private so that only I would see it and title the story \u201cJason pls pls pls read\u201d (jason isn\u2019t my real name but you get the idea). She showed up to my house one time with gifts I didn\u2019t ask for, it was some merch from my favorite shows and some cheep wish.com clothes. She\u2019d post pictures of me to her instagram and would caption it cringey shit like \u201c#mr.sideprofile\u201d I never asked her to do that, she just did. Overtime her texts to me became increasingly explicit. The final straw was when she asked me to \u201cfuck her savagely\u201d after that I said she was really creepy and blocked her on everything. I could\u2019ve done that ages ago before it got extreme and I should have but that doesn\u2019t make what she did okay. \n\nAfter I blocked her she tried emailing me multiple times through different accounts and started texting my friends and was playing the victim saying \u201che blocked me and i don\u2019t know why\ud83e\udd7a\u201d my friends told me and asked me who this was and i explained everything to them, after which they told her to fuck off. For a couple days that was it, not much happened with her. \n\nOne the first day of the semester at a new school I transferred to, I get a call from campus police, saying I need to talk with them. I meet up in an office with some office worker and a cop. They told me about some comments that were made on the school\u2019s instagram. They showed me a printout of it. It was a bunch of sock puppet accounts commenting on posts saying that I was a rapist and have sexually assaulted many people. I knew instantly it was her doing. She didn\u2019t even do a good job of hiding it. All the accounts names were from things she knew I liked. One was \u201ccorpse bride casting\u201d and another was \u201cstarplatinum_gold47\u201d They were all references to shows and movies i liked. Luckily I had screenshots of her trying to ask me for sex and other weird crazy shit she did. After i showed them all that and explained who she was, they believed me and said they would open a case against her, nothing ever came of it though and it was eventually closed because apparently the cop couldn\u2019t get in contact with her. The comments were the last thing she did and it\u2019s been quiet from her. The damage had been done though. My reputation was fucked. I\u2019ve lost count of how many times i\u2019ve had to explain to people i\u2019m not a rapist. It doesn\u2019t always work. My peers would talk about it and try to warn people of me. I tried asking the faculty to do something about it but they don\u2019t do shit. \n\nI\u2019m tired and angry all the time. I want to be normal. I want to take action. I don\u2019t want to live like this anymore. I\u2019m so tired of being made out to be a monster. I\u2019m not. I want people to leave me alone and let me live. \n\nPlease offer your advice on how I can deal this. Anything would be greatly appreciated. Thank you",

Needless to say I thought he was joking, since he never showed any signs of being \u201cconservative\u201d or whatever you want to call it, and is supportive of women in general. \n\nHe started saying that I\u2019m inappropriate and I shouldn\u2019t be there wearing a tank top (remind you: we were the only two people present) I lack decor and I should cover up because I\u2019m disrespecting the entire university and my teachers\u2019 job by exposing my shoulders apparently.

Use this time now to get him to tell his stories, and record them so that you can write them down for his grandkids to enjoy.\n\nYour dad is going to lose his ability to swallow, and will eventually need a feeding tube.  So cook what he loves, take him out to restaurants he loves, and order in food he loves, while you can.\n\nYour dad is going to lose his mobility, and navigating the world in a wheelchair (especially a power chair, which he is likely going to eventually need) is anything but easy.  So if there are places he likes to go, do it now while you still can.  Your dad is going to tire easily and anything you plan for him needs to account for that.",

        "Question": "My mom has kept $30k in child support money and plans on using it to buy herself a house.\nFor context, I, recently turned 18, and have always lived with my mom since my parents split up when I was around 11. I was never the closest to my dad growing up, but as I got older, that slowly changed. \n\nRecently my divorced parents got into an argument over how much my dad was giving as child support money. He was giving a large sum per month and my mom was arguing that it wasn't enough and she needed even more. She claimed that she needed to cover my wifi, water + electric bill, phone bill, a $500 monthly credit card, my insurances, etc., and that all added up to well over what he was giving her.  \n\nAfter hearing about this, I spoke to my dad directly about it all and listened to all he had to say, his concerns, why the conversation came up, and in my opinion, it was all fair. He has his own life and other things going on obviously, and this whole argument had started because he was thinking about lowering the amount that he would be giving as child support. He had suggested cutting it in half and was asking for a full breakdown of how much my \"monthly expenses\" were in order to figure out if what he was considering giving would still be plenty. Low and behold, it was, way more even. As I mentioned, I recently turned 18 and am a legal adult, there technically speaking is no longer a requirement for him to even continuing offering me aid financially and I am very much grateful for whatever amount I can get, especially since I plan on attending college and moving out of my moms house as soon as possible. \n\nNow for the main issue: In the midst of this debate, after I figured out that my bills weren't anywhere close to what my dad was giving me, I asked my mom where the rest of the money was. She says that she had actually been pocketing the money in hopes of using it as a down payment to a house for \"us\" in a outskirt city a few hours away where I do not want to live. As the title suggests, she racked up about $30k. \n\nI've made it clear to her that I'm moving out and don't want to live in that city at any point, but that's where she wants a house. So now my concern and what'd I'd like advice with is if I'm wrong for feeling like that money should be going to me and not to her potential house? In my mind I sound like an A-hole for even believing it but from what I remember there really was no mention of this money until I found out about it. She claims that she's mentioned it several times before but I honestly am not sure if I remember her bringing it up or not. \n\nI'd also like to make it known that I do not like to talk to my mom about things like this because anytime I do, I end up feeling like the bad guy. For example, the moment I sat down to talk to her about the expenses, she started yelling and saying I'm just like my dad and that if I want to act like him I can just go live with him. \n\nI don't intend on spending the money or going crazy with this huge amount, but college is right around the corner and being able to pay that off fairly easily sounds really good to me. I also have to pay my dad $5k back for my car that he helped me purchase; I currently have two jobs while in high school to ensure I have enough money to support myself, but Im just worrying too much about the near-coming future?\n\nSo again, am I wrong for thinking that I should be able to use that money for my college? What should I do about this situation? Feel free to ask any extra questions for more information.",

For context, I am black and if you do not know some blacks people do not wash their hair everytime they shower. This isn\u2019t unhygienic, some hair just doesn\u2019t retain as much moisture and doesn\u2019t need to be washed. I wasn\u2019t upset that she asked this and told her I felt fine.
