I was out to everyone around me, bar my child, and I decided then that I would tell my child when old enough because other people were threatening to do it for me to try to embarrass me. It only would have embarrassed my child, like you are just now, if I hadn't prepared in advance.\n\nI laid the groundwork so that sex and sexuality, and women's choices were all discussed before I told my child. Then I told them slowly in an age appropriate way over the years. And they were fine. \n\nThey were fine because they were taught that any legal sex between consenting adults is a diverse subject that really has nothing to do with other people.",

I reached out to my mom asking her if she got invited out and she left me on read.

His response was \u201cI can never make you happy\u201dand I stopped and realized and thought about what he said to me that day. I still remember it clearly. He was right he can\u2019t make me happy only I can make myself happy and only he can make himself happy. And only you can make your happy. You will never be able to make your dad happy and your not on this planet to make him happy. If he can\u2019t do it on his own it\u2019s because he has issues that he needs to work on, like myself. My son and I are now in a better place. He got a job at a gym and I enjoy talking to him now because he is not complaining no more. He is having fun with his life and that\u2019s all I ever wanted for him.

If you live that girl who gives a fuck as long as you and her are happy together. You are the one who is gonna share your life with her not your dad. You have to be able to please your self before you can please others. When you get that he will envy you because he won\u2019t know how to get what you have.

I was a little unsure about it at first because I thought it\u2019s going to change our relationship but no, everything\u2019s the same basically. We also have a friend who I call T because she\u2019s basically the focal point of the story. \n\nT is a trans woman. I get along with her really good until yesterday. I don\u2019t even know how it really came up but I talked with her and called my bf \"he\". She looked at me very pissed and told me to not misgender him, especially in her presence because it\u2019s disrespectful. I told her that he goes by both he AND they pronouns. She basically dismissed it and said that it\u2019s still disrespectful because by calling him \"him\" I\u2019m being cis-normative and borderline transphobic. \n\nEventually I brought my bf to us and asked him what he thinks because that\u2019s basically what\u2019s important. He said that it\u2019s fine because (again) he goes by both he and they pronouns. T was basically just like \"whatever\" and was kinda rude to me the whole evening. Didn\u2019t even say me goodbye, just walk straight past me. \n\nI talked with my bf about it again and apologised if I hurt him in any way but he said that it\u2019s okay. He then showed me messages of him and T and T told him that he shouldn\u2019t allow me misgendering him and that he can\u2019t let people walk over him. \n\nI honestly feel really bad about all of this. Like my bf said it\u2019s okay but I obviously don\u2019t know if he\u2019s being serious. And I kinda feel like a bigot even though I know I\u2019m not transphobic.",

My only friends think I'm gross for having sex and a baby before marriage. I'm not even Christian anymore. The only people who want to talk to me are creepy dudes who want a one night stand or want to get with a vulnerable woman to harm me more. I like white guys, I need to point that out, but most of them are rude and give me unsolicited opinions about how they'd never date a black woman or how I should have used protection and they wouldn't raise a black man's baby when I didn't ask them to. I'm just looking for friends and get that BS the moment I they find out. My mom hates me and her solution is to find another man. I work overnights so my parents can babysit and my coworkers hate me too. The nicest ones don't even speak English.\n\nI live in Mankato, Minnesota. Not many black people here, and the ones that are here are mostly from Somalia, a Muslim country, and most of them don't speak much English. I met some Somalian people a few years ago, but a lady I used to talk to a lot now says I should get back with my abusive ex because raising a baby without him goes against God, and I'm gross for not being married before sex. That's probably most of their culture's opinions. I'm so tired of religion being used against me and racist white people making me feel like dirt. I should move, but I don't know where I can go where I'd be welcome. I'm not trying to get with another man. I just want friends so I don't go insane. I don't know what I can do around here when I work overnights, sleep in the afternoons, and don't know people to go to bars with. (Don't want to drink either because I'm nursing.)\n\nI think I'm on the autism spectrum and stumble over my words when I'm talking in person along with feeling like crap and always embarrassed like a spotlight is on me.\n\nThanks for any advice.

The management has been really awful and we have a high staff turnover. Up until recently we were not allowed any days off and if we were sick we were still expected to work as we could \u201cjust sit in the classroom and tell the children what to do\u201d. This kind of approach lead to 3 teachers leaving at once, resulting in me having to cover many new classes or even have 2 year levels in a class at once (which is difficult when they\u2019re on completely different curriculum/topics and need individual attention). \nA few weeks ago we hired more teachers so we could all have a lighter work load and be covered if someone was sick or needed a day off. The manager was the first one to take advantage of this and took a day off for a family birthday. So I also put in a request to have a day off as my partner is a professional athlete and will be playing in a very important final next week. I got the day approved and I worked out travel and accommodation for the match. That is until today, when she texted me to say that I can\u2019t have the day off anymore because she injured her foot  (a small cut with a couple of stitches) and is now on 2 weeks of sick leave, meaning I have to cover her classes. I didn\u2019t reply because I was extremely frustrated and didn\u2019t know how to respond so I went to the gym to blow off some steam.

        "Question": "Is my girlfriend toxic or am I just overreacting?\nHello,\n\nMy girlfriend, about 2 weeks ago, asked if I would be interested in going on a trip to Mexico with her. As a young person who doesn\u2019t have the most amount of expendable money to their name and is trying to save up as much money possible over the next couple of years to begin the process of purchasing my own home, I told her I\u2019m not sure it would be the best idea financially for me. Fortunately though, I do have a job that pays out bonuses! An average bonus can be around $2000 after taxes, which so happens to be just about the amount each of us would pay to go to Mexico. Knowing this, I told her if I got a bonus of at least $2000 this quarter, I would be fine going to Mexico! She agreed. \n\nFast forward 2 weeks. I now know that I will be receiving at least $2000 on my bonus. \n\nExpecting her to be happy, as she loves going to Mexico, I told her that I\u2019m willing to go to Mexico since I have the extra cash on hand. Unexpectedly, she said she no longer wants to go due to the fact that \u201cIt\u2019s not fair that I\u2019ve been handed a bonus check and that she would have to work to save up the money\u201d. \n\nIn my opinion, it shouldn\u2019t matter how I got the money. If she was perfectly fine with working to get the money before she knew I received my bonus, she should be perfectly fine working after she knew I got the bonus. \n\nPlease tell me if you agree with me or not and why. I\u2019d love to know everyone\u2019s honest opinion.",

She asked me several times to not say anything to him.

He's an all around asshole, and I just hate him. About a year ago he was fishing on a boat, and it sank, 1 person who was onboard died, and ever since he's been a little more fucked than usual. He's done nothing but drink and get mad and yell ever since. Sure he did all of that stuff before on a weekly basis, but ever since it's been on about a daily basis. So for about a year he just didn't work whatsoever because he's been scared to go back on a boat, but since we're broke as shit he finally went back on the water for a week last week. Apparently they tormented him on the boat and kept playing tricks about the boat going down to fuck with him, so he came home and went on a 3 day bender, yelling and breaking shit for 3 days straight. My mom also happens to be pretty sick, and she's having lots of lung related problems,and she has to go in tomorrow overnight. And he wants me to stay tomorrow to keep him company. Now the thing is, I know if I stay, I'm probably not going to leave my room once so I don't see what difference it makes. On top of that I've already missed a lot of school recently, and while he was on his bender I didn't leave my room for 3 days, so I haven't eaten in 3 days, because I obviously didn't want to go out and deal with him screaming and breaking shit, so for that reason alone I think he deserves to be alone for a day.

        "Question": "[F 21] Dad stole $4200 from me to \"make a point\"\nOur bank is Navy Federal, and he's the veteran, so unfortunately, he's the sponsor who oversees my bank account.\n\nI had gotten 5000$ as a refund for not living on campus anymore. I live at home bc it's cheaper and because it's only 30 minutes away.\n\nI did spend money on small things, like lunch or dinner, bc I don't have a meal plan at college anymore.\n\nMy parents got pissed that I wasn't home by 9 pm last night due to a literary magazine meeting that ended at 9:30. Normally my curfew is 10. \n\nAs a result, my dad took $4200 out of my account, left me with no money in my checkings, and left me with only $600 dollars in savings. Keep in mind that I have to pay for college next semester, so that's not going to work at all. \n\nI have a job that pays $11.75 per hour, and I live in AL, so that's not bad ig. The thing is, I planned on not only paying for next sem bc my grandma's money wouldn't cover it, but I also planned on moving out to an apartment to get out of this abusive household. \n\nMy parents said that I'd get the money back \"when I can prove that I'm mature\" or something. But since I can never get their approval on anything I do anyway, I know that'll never happen. \n\nThis feels incredibly wrong to me. Most of that money was the refund from college that my gma is paying for, and some of it I even earned. My dad did give me a generous amount at one point but I can't remember how much it was.\n\nWhat can I do to get that money back? I feel like he just stole everything from me. Or what should I do now, when I can't pay for next semester and can't pay to move out?",

We\u2019ve always lived in the same house, but since mom passed in \u201809, the quality of our home has completely went to hell. Never cleaned, etc, and was never forced to pick up or have a daily routine. I recently got on new meds to help w depression and to overall motivate me to live a better life while I do counseling and other things. Dad and I both are severely mentally ill, but he has never got treatment. He is retired now, but does nothing all day. The state of our house is completely unlivable at this point, mold to where one room is completely closed off and I can\u2019t breathe (I have asthma and severe allergies), it is also just filled with trash bags, etc. We have carpets in every room but kitchen and bathroom, all of which are completely destroyed, so much clutter to where it\u2019s unbearable and there is no living space (house is only 800 sqft). Dad sleeps on the nastiest couch with the dogs (we adopted before mom passed). I want to completely tear down the house and build a new one. He just wants to start on fixing the house by \u201cexpanding the closed off bedroom\u201d. We don\u2019t have any appliances replaced because even if someone would come inside to help install, how would we even get around things. PLEASE, I am desperate for tips to start this project and I am young and clueless how to, I cannot live like this anymore. If all goes well, I will potentially have a job making $70,000+ soon (fingers crossed). We are well below poverty line, so all I can think about is how I want to tear down this place, as I think it is well beyond saving, and build our new home. Thank you all.

To me, it takes more of a priority over a bathroom because #1, a third bathroom isnt absolutely needed, Its more of a want imo and #2, the other two bathrooms have been renovated and look very good aesthetically. \n\nMy gf doesnt look at the hvac situation as seriously as i do and is dead set on this bathroom. She doesnt seem to be budging on this. What do you guys think? Btw, i would do both repairs/additions at the same time, but money plays a factor. The price to add a bathroom could be the same or more as the hvac system. We haven\u2019t moved in or gotten proper estimates yet.",

        "Question": "Was I groomed by my teacher at 15? My therapist says I was. I\u2019m now 24 and the teacher is suddenly emailing me.\nThis is my first time using Reddit, so apologies in advance if i\u2019m doing anything incorrectly and sorry if this is too long.\n\nI was very close to a teacher at school when i was 15/16. She was a woman (29) and so am I. I suffered badly from panic attacks, anxiety, grief and depression. She would always comfort me and help me through it. She was caring and very good at teaching her subject. But some of her behaviour left me feeling very confused and uncomfortable. \n\nShe would discuss her personal life with me, including details about her relationship with her boyfriend and her sex life. She\u2019d say to me that i was one of her favourites, compliment my appearance sometimes and touch me often - like cradling my face or stroking my hair. She\u2019d often stare at me intently during class/around the school and mistakenly say my name when talking to another student or compliment me to other students.\n\nI found all of this really overwhelming and her intimidating. This led to me getting palpitations around her, feeling sick, weak/shaky or like i\u2019d pass out in her class. I couldn\u2019t eat my lunch before her lessons because i was afraid of how her behaviour made me feel. I always thought I just had a crush on her because she was a great teacher, attractive, and young. It made me question my sexuality at the time. \n\nAfter I left school in 2015, we stayed in touch for a few years through her school email very occasionally. I then found out that she\u2019d left the school and heard nothing from her for 4 years.\n\nI\u2019m now 24 and suddenly a few days ago, she emailed me through her personal email and I was shocked. I got the same feelings of nausea, shakiness and breathlessness that I got in her class. She said in the email that because it was International Women\u2019s Day, she thought of me and wanted to check how I am (odd?). She told me that she\u2019d left the school and also left teaching and she hopes i\u2019m \u201ccontinuing to be amazing\u201d.\n\nWhen i told my therapist about this all, she said that I had been groomed by my teacher at 15 and I was made to feel special by her, which then made me feel like I had a crush on her. \n\nI\u2019m finding it difficult to process because i thought this teacher was a good person and someone i missed, looked up to and loved. Am I in denial that I was groomed? Did she take advantage of me? I feel like what if I\u2019m making things up and the lines are blurry. The idea of \u201cbeing groomed\u201d makes me feel very upset, angry, almost \u2018dirty\u2019 and traumatised :(",

There have been 4 occurrences within the last 6 weeks of bullying to the extent that my daughter is throwing up before school due to anxiety and has now missed a number of days.  This is Kindergarten for Christ's sake.\n\nWe have sent 4 emails detailing each occurrence.  The teachers and principal are involved, and after the 3rd occurrence, the parents of the bully were informed.  After this 4th occurrence we again sent an email and the principal essentially responded with \"all we can do is inform the other parents\".\n\nThis tells me that the school cannot address bullying.  They have told me they have \"safety plans\" but won't go into detail what those plans are, except that they are designed to address bullying etc.  Clearly these plans are not working.\n\nI'm really thinking that either the school is trying to protect itself, or that the teachers and principal have had their wings clipped to the extent that they can't actually use discipline etc.  I'm at a loss as to what to do here.\n\nI'm thinking of either escalating to the school board and / or engaging the media at this point.  Is this advisable or can anyone think of a better alternative?  I really don't want my daughter to switch schools.\n\nThanks",

        "Question": "How do I ask school admins to change playground rules?\nI have a really great 10 year old 4th grader. Smart, funny, kind and helpful. I may be biased but overall a mature and lovely person. She attends a newer public school, part of the inaugural kindergarten class so there for 5 years now. The school just put in a playground a few weeks ago and obviously the kids are all very excited. \n\nApparently, the admins have decided to put some rules in place, which makes sense in general. However, they have also assigned a group of students to be the \"safety committee\" to make sure the rules are being followed. These kids walk around during recess with clipboards and write names down. This doesn't sit right with me to begin with, but I'm having a hard time articulating why.\n\nI have not received a copy of the rules, but my kid says things like no running (um ok, shouldn't kids run and play outside?), 2 kids on the bars at a time, 5 \"tricks\" on bars (like flipping over), 20 swings on the swings. So the safety committee stands around with clipboards and write down names of rule violaters and if your name gets on the list 3 times you go to the principal. \n\nThis by itself just sounds so stupid to me so I'm looking for advice on how to approach this with the school. \n\nAdd to it that it seems no one informed the kids about the safety committee so all of a sudden there's just a bunch of narcs floating around giving kids anxiety about the threat of being in trouble.\n\nTop it all off with the fact that one of the kids on the safety committee was bullying my kid last year (nothing major but it was a friend that was jealous my kid was starting to spend time with other friends and bad enough that the bully was moved to a different class). So this bully is now targeting my kid and basically standing there watching them specifically every day. My kid tried to speak to admins without bringing up the bully specifically, just the rules and committee in general, and was basically told these are the rules and to deal. \n\nToday the bully told my kids teacher that they are watching closely since my kid breaks rules often. My kids teacher said that doesn't seem fair but didn't do much about it and suggested my kid write a letter to the admins. \n\nAny advice on how to approach this and make strong arguments against a safety committee of kids and general dumb playground rules?",

There's no way that doesn't lead to bullying.

They were super awesome, well off, amazing jobs. Needless to say the kid was going to be set, better off than i ever was and I was raised middle class. They paid for all the hospital expenses, pampered her, let us stay at their house. It was the best option for us at the time, cause neither of us felt right getting an abortion, but knew we weren't ready to be parents. Flash forward to now, that girl and I broke up more than a decade ago, good riddance honestly. I met my NOW wife a few years after the break up, we have two boys, and life is good. Parenting is hard, I do not regret what we did and the choices we made. The way our relationship went after the adoption was horrible. She cheated, manipulated, tormented. The true colors showed once we were out of high school and got to expirence the real world. Just weigh your options man, think about your future self. Good luck and hope you the best.",

Then got next to the car and refresh the app, if there is a tracker in or on the car you'll notice a new device appearing in the app. Look at the distance which is in meters, then walk around to different sides of the car, and look at the distance. The lower the distance means the closer you are to the Air Tag. The app should display Air Tag so it should be really easy to find in the app when looking at it.

Robby's in his senior year of high school and he's honestly always been a good kid. I love that little brat.\n\nHowever, a few nights ago, I was in the middle of watching cobra kai while Brian was at work. I get a frantic call from Robby. I'll spare the details but he said that he had no money and was in emergency need of Plan B for his girlfriend (F18). He begged me not to tell his parents, and I agreed to it. It's worth noting that he doesn't have a car just yet, and apparently neither does his girlfriend. The kid was freaking out and screaming on the phone, so I took some time to calm him down and reassure him that his future was not ruined and everything was going to be okay.\n\nI went to the nearby CVS and even bought two Plan Bs in case this happens again in the future, and drove down to Robby. My sister and BIL were out for the night, and Robby couldn't thank me enough. I told him not to mention it and also advised him to stay careful in the future. Robby begged me to keep this between us, and I agreed to spare him embarrassment. Unfortunately, I got an angry call from Lisa the next morning, and she had found the other Plan B in Robby's bathroom drawer while she was cleaning the bathroom. She said it was out of line for me to go and do that behind her back, and that I should've told her and Harold. I said that Brian was freaking out and I didn't want to embarrass him or make him feel bad, but Lisa said I was an AH for interfering with her parenting, and that me \"advising him to stay careful in the future\" was an inappropriate thing to say to my own nephew. It's literally gotten to a point where Harold and even a couple of Lisa's friends have been messaging me. I haven't even told Brian about this to keep Robby's word. I wasn't judging him at all, I really was just trying to help.\n\nSince then, I've still been getting messages from Lisa, Harold, and their friends. I haven't responded to a single one, and I even posted to AITA about this before it got taken down. I got a lot of advice on giving Robby the talk, but I'm extremely worried about how inappropriate that's just going to look. But at the same time, I fear that Robby might be uneducated on this stuff, as Lisa and Harold have honestly always been weird about this. Where do I go from here?",

They said, \"we can dye it that color, no problem, no bleach will be used.\" After dyeing it, my hair came out two very different colors. Then they apply something in my hair. I ask what it is and, it's bleach.

I look like a clown now with different colors on my hair (orange at the root and brownish red at the body). But the worst of it all is that I have bleach in my hair and I'm upset that my hair will never be the same. I will have to keep cutting it until the damaged bleached hair is gone. I have curly hair so my curls will most likely not be the same also. \n\nI wanted a refund for this experience. These stylist did whatever they wanted to me.

(They are so clueless) I explain that I'm never coming back and leave with damaged hair, orange roots, and redish/brown hair, a lousy blowout, an uneven trim, and the delight of being shouted at by two extremely unprofessional ladies. Not to mention I paid $140 for this nightmare.\n\nI spoke to friends they're all in shock of such an experience and they warn me that in a couple of months, my hair might fall out bc of the bleach \ud83d\ude22 . I am considering suing this business. What are your thoughts?",

        "Aswer": "Wow I'm so sorry you experienced this, that is very unprofessional. Just to calm your anxiety. I have curly hair as well, and have bleached it more than I would like to admit. You will see some breakage at the ends but I can assure you it's not going to fall out. Use a deep conditioning treatment if it seems damaged, gradually trim the ends rather than just cutting it all, there is no reason you should have to lose your length and your money. You could take it to small claims but I feel in the long run it would be worth more of your energy than it's worth. If it is a corporation call and make a complaint on the salon specifically those ladies, we don't need people like that in the industry, they can have their license revoked. I know a lot of people are against doing their hair at home, but I personally do because of an experience similar to this, and I did attend cosmetology school.  Your roots are much lighter because they take bleach the fastest. Go to Sally's get a toner and developer of your shade choice  I would recommend like a burgundy shade a little darker than the ends of your hair and just do the roots, it will give you a nice ombre affect. If you do decide to do  a dye at home, feel free to reach out with the look you were going for and I can offer more advice and walk you through it.",

Yes, this is a serious question and not a troll even though it may sound like one. I know, it's weird. I've been addicted to masturbation, edging, and porn since I was 12 years old, and my addiction has never been worse than it is right now.\n\nTo break it all down for you, I typically edge to porn for around 10-12 hours a day, sleep for 4-6 hours a night, and then spend the remaining 6-8 hours of my day getting my priorities done (going to class, studying, and doing my homework). I'm still doing well in all of my college courses, and I enjoy learning and feeling successful by getting stellar grades. So at least that hasn't changed for me. \n\nBut besides that, I just masturbate for 10-12 hours a day and sleep for a little bit. I can't even remember the last time that I slept for more than seven hours in a single night. It's probably been around two months now. I wish that I could stop, but I don't really have a reason to at the same time. I don't have a girlfriend to make love with or anything. \n\nSo, how can I stop? At the end of the day, I do realize that this is really unhealthy and that I need to get rid of this addiction.",

Sure I'd buy alcohol, and I was mostly honest about it, (Yo, can you spare some change for alcohol and I promise you I won't buy food) was my line, but most the time I'd buy food lol. \n\nSo they'll more than likely will be getting their fix or maybe they'll get food, but now when I give back, after the money leaves my hand to theirs it's really none of my business what they spend it on.

Even if you can't cook and make only simple things, do you know how to make an ice cream sundae or make tacos together or make your own personal pizzas or nachos? Something where you get a chance to do an activity together. \n\n2. Go to Walmart (go with her) and pick out some arts and crafts supplies and draw pictures together. Even if you aren't good at art, doesn't matter, what matters is doing something together, maybe she takes your picture home and you keep hers. Or there are like craft kits for making little window/mirror decorations, just scrolling online there's like a paint your own unicorn, you could even give her a little sketchbook to draw in. Just stay away from things with small parts and beads and such. \n\n3. Does she have a designated place to sleep for her? Maybe you two can go pick out a blanket together that she keeps at your place, or stuffed animal, or pillow etc. Something that's hers for her sleeping spot to feel more comfortable. (sorry I'm thinking of a lot of purchasing ideas). \n\n4. Watch some movies together. Maybe some movies you liked as a kid if you have a streaming service that she hasn't seen before. Hell watch some star wars and make lightsabers out of cardboard boxes and such. \n\n5. If there's time when she visits and one near by, take her to the aquarium. They're excellent places. Also much better than the zoo. Maybe you go to the aquarium and afterwards you both draw your favorite fish that you saw while eating dinner? Or maybe you get her a little portable camera to take photos, or you let her take photos of the fish with your phone? \n\nProbably not the best ideas but hopefully inspire some other ones for you.

He asked me what it would take for us to get back together. I said to stop sleeping with karen and have her move out would be a start. She moves out within two days. He says karen is moving to a different branch of the franchise they work for so he also wont have to see here there, but they are in a soccer league together that meets once a week for the next 5 weeks. I asked him to block karen and go no contact with her.

        "Aswer": "It\u2019s a very personal choice that no one here can make for you. But if you\u2019re asking strangers then you may either feel pressured (directly or indirectly) by your friends or you are slightly interested but nervous. It\u2019s not a hard drug - you won\u2019t get physically or mentally hooked after a couple of hits. But it can be habit forming and many people get sucked into it that way.\n\nWe\u2019ll speak only recreationally because medical is a whole other topic. First, I\u2019d personally recommend not smoking before 25. I\u2019m not sure how old you are but I have many friends who smoked in high school and \u2018claim\u2019 negative side effects like bad memory loss etc. it\u2019s better to wait for your brain to fully develop. \n\nIf you do want to try it, start small. Don\u2019t get pressured into doing more than your comfortable and give yourself some time to feel the effects before continuing. I usually find with smoking that 10-20 minutes after the hit I can feel it. Edibles are different and can take 30 minutes to 1.5+ hours.\n\nDifferent types of weed have different effects. You may not like what you smoke, but it could be the strain. You can always try another one later.\n\nYou may get paranoid. Just remember that it won\u2019t kill you and take deep breaths. Be close to people you trust who can help keep you relaxed. A good environment means a good high.\n\nWeed can be a good way to relax and hang out with friends - like drinking can - but it can also help distress from a long day. Do what feels right for you but if you find yourself smoking from morning until night, or you feel a compulsion to smoke before every meal, consider taking a break.\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEdit: updated age to 25 per many recommendations. Personally I started at 20 as many do in college but I\u2019m sure medically the recommendation is 25. If it\u2019s occasional and small amounts I don\u2019t think there\u2019s significant side effects.\n\nEdit 2: as always anyone who is neurodivergent or has a mental illness should always be cautious about using substances. If you see a therapist or psychiatrist and feel comfortable with them try to be honest about your usage. It\u2019ll help them help you and may impact what medications they recommend.",

This now makes it where he cannot drive anymore. \n\nMost of America (including where he lives) is built around people using cars to get around. I worry that him not being able to drive will completely strip him of his independence and leave him feeling depressed. \n\nI really want to be there for him and I want to sit my family down and suggest that they move to a city that is more walkable. Some place where he can go do the grocery shopping, go see a movie, really just do basic little things without having to ask someone to help him get there. \n\nI currently live in NYC so that was my first option, however my mother has ASD and the city is incredibly overstimulating for her. I\u2019m wondering if there are any other cities/ towns people know of that are walkable/ more accessible to people who can\u2019t drive. Preferably something on the East Coast so I can still see them",

They\u2019re my world and honestly I\u2019ve been beating myself up even having these thoughts but recently I\u2019ve doubted if she\u2019s really my biological daughter. We have similarities but there are certain things that have me second guessing. My wife and I both have green eyes I\u2019m mixed and she\u2019s Italian and American. My baby has brown eyes I know it\u2019s a possible for two green eyed parents to have a brown eyed baby but I\u2019ve read it\u2019s rare. \n\nA few years back I had to travel for work and I had my suspicions of my wife cheating but the thought alone brought me to tears. I discussed it with her and she assured me she was loyal to me. She has cheated in her previous relationship but I didn\u2019t want to judge based on that because she was in high school and we\u2019ve all done dumb shit we regret as kids. \n\nI have discussed my concerns with her and to say I caused an argument would be an understatement. She got extremely upset and asked me how I could insinuate that she would ever cheat on me or that my baby isn\u2019t mine. I\u2019ve spoken to her in the past ab my doubts and she told me she would never cheat. I brought it up again and said I had my doubts but I\u2019ll drop it and apologized. She got very defensive and started crying saying \u201cI guess you want a paternity test since you don\u2019t believe me\u201d. I said no but after speaking with my family about it I think I may want one just to clear my mind. If she\u2019s mine I\u2019ll hate myself for ever being doubtful but if she\u2019s not I still haven\u2019t thought about the consequences that can bring. She is my daughter and I love her no matter what but what will that do to my marriage. \n\nThis has caused me so much internal conflict and I\u2019ve spent nights crying thinking I could be making the biggest mistake of my life.

        "Aswer": "Okay, my advice? Take 3 steps back!\n\nI understand your doubts, the might be valid but when focusing on just eye color you have about a 25% change of that happening (a lot of other factors come in but it's a ballpark) that's the same as flipping heads twice in a row... Happens all the time!\n\nFirst: Before you do anything decide what you would do if the child isn't yours. Are you actually leaving? Or would you stay regardless?\n\nThere was a story on Reddit lately from a MIL that did the testing for the couple and it broke the guys heart because it was a SA baby and he really didn't want to know so he could keep pretending it was his. \n\nIf you stay regardless I can imagine it being worse if you would know she isn't yours. \n\nLeaving would be a valid choice, let's get that clear. However you need to decide before you do the test what the results will mean for you, because knowing may hurt you more than not knowing.\n\nSecond: get couples counseling, recently heard a story where after a good talk through a therapist both partners were on the same page (and got the test). Where your feelings are valid so are your wife's feelings. And finding a middle ground while both coming from a place of hurt is (almost) impossible. \n\nThird: if you really can't live without knowing and you can't find middle ground on this test, your relationship is already over. You will either resent yourself for not pushing, your partner for not agreeing or she will resent you for doing it anyway. Resentment is a top indicator (iirc even the number 1 indicator) for a failing relationship. Realize NOW if you really need that resentment in your life (in whatever shape) and act accordingly. \n\nBut, if you are ending the relationship anyway, might as well get the test through a court before paying child support.",

I got to know because that married man's wife, Kelly (32F) showed up to my place to talk to my boyfriend but he wasn't there at that time.

        "Question": "My girlfriend (23F) is asking me (23M) to unfollow girls I know on Instagram.\nSo my girlfriend of almost 1.5 years has very bad anxiety, and I do all that I can to ease her worries, reassure her I love her, and help her out. Things have been rough for us both personally, but our relationship has been good together for the most part.\n\nToday, out of the blue, I woke up to a long message about how she doesn't like me following other girls on Instagram (mind you, these are girls I've met once or twice either at EDM festivals, just out and about, struck up a conversation once or twice and or mutuals. I've never had anything romantic with them and I have no intentions on hitting them up/cheating on my girlfriend.). This was a recurring topic for a while that died down for a very long time, but just came up again. I told her I never talk to these girls online really, and I never check their pages, their feeds, etc and that there's nothing to worry about. I'm hardly even much of a media person outside of YouTube. I know she has problems with guys following models, but I don't do that. So I said that I don't want her to be controlling towards me because I'm never that way with her, and I'm not okay with her if she gives me this ultimatum when I've done so much for her to try to ease her anxiety and prove to her that I love her. (BTW she is posted on my Instagram so other girls would know I have a girlfriend anyway)\n\nShe says that me being reluctant to unfollow them shows I value them more than I value my relationship with her and that me following other girls gives her the ick. But for me, it's not about her telling me to unfollow specific people -- for me, it's about upholding my standards and establishing what trust means and not letting other people tell me how to manage my social media, etc. I have no problem unfollowing these people, but I think it points to larger red flags if she feels this way simply about me following these girls I don't interact with at all.\n\nAm I in the wrong for not unfollowing these girls I don't interact with on Insta because my girlfriend wants me to? Should I just leave?",

I have matured from these insecurities after therapy but honestly medication was the biggest help for my anxiety/self esteem. Try and explain your point of view with understanding and sensitivity. If she isn\u2019t willing to trust you and to begin to self love it will be impossible for her to maintain a healthy relationship with you or anyone else. Do you interact with the specific girls at all by swiping on stories or liking lots of their photos? Is there a reason she feels insecure about them in particular?",

I feel like I'm being a jerk if I just buy one chair though, because people will come over, and I will only have my own chair and nothing for them, and I am breaking some social contract.

My parents are divorced and my father has primary custody and we are with my mother every other weekend. My twin sister Mia and I are extremely close and always have been. \n\nMia is gay and that\u2019s the main reason my stepfather has been mean to her ever since he met her but Saturday he crossed a line. I\u2019ve talked to my father about how my stepfather behaves towards my sister and he\u2019s had multiple conversations with my stepfather telling him to quit some of which have gotten very heated. Most of what he\u2019s been doing is calling her names and being very rude and disrespectful towards her. \n\nSaturday my sister had just gotten out of the shower she had gotten dressed walking out of the upstairs bathroom which is a few steps away from the top of the stairs. My mom and stepfather\u2019s bedroom right beside it. As my sister was walking out of the bathroom she had turned to walk down the stairs when my stepfather came out of the bedroom. He called her a homophobic slur then pushed her from behind and sent her falling down the stairs. \n\nI ran to check on my sister and aside from a broken arm and busted lip she was ok. I then called 911 and asked for the police and an ambulance. The police arrived first and I told them what had happened and they arrested my stepfather for aggravated battery. The ambulance arrived not long after to take my sister to the hospital. I rode in the ambulance with my sister and called our father who met us at the hospital. \n\nMy sister is ok they took X-rays and checked her for other injuries then put a cast on her arm that she\u2019ll get off in about two months. They kept her overnight for observation then sent her home the following morning. So she\u2019s going to be just fine. \n\nSince then my mother has been calling me nonstop and sending me text messages telling me that I ruined her life and should be ashamed for calling 911 and not giving her time to make up a story before taking my sister to the hospital.

        "Question": "Boyfriend constantly not sure if he wants me\nLong story short:\n\nMe (26F) and my boyfriends (26M) were together for 2 years. Everything was ok the first 6 months. I fell into a horrible depression, that kind that makes not to be able to eat, sleep, stay alone. He was not supportive and cricitized me for taking medication and not doing things to get better. That was just a month or two. He also confessed that has thought about separation and couldnt stand the situation with me being depressed, because he was feeling ok and wanted someone that motivates him to be productive and do things. Also he left me alone after a panick attack at a doctor's appointment (I also had health issues, this being the main reason for my depression), because it was his lunch break and wanted to get back home to eat.\n\nFast forward I recovered quickly and forgave him. After 3 months he wanted again to separate because we had a routine and he didnt feel challanged by the relationship. We stayed together.\n\nFast forward again after 6 months he wanted again to separate and start telling that he doesnt know what he wants. He also said he wanted separation and after 5 min said he didnt. We stayed together.\n\nAgain fast forward 2 months I felt he  has changed behaviour and asked him if moving together was still on the table as we decided a month ago. He said no, I am not the girl he sees his future with and also he has seen his high school love with whom he had been in a \"relationship\" for 3 weeks and compared feelings and the ones for her were stronger. I broke up with him.\n\nHe begged me to stay, promised he will change, came to see me in the hospital, was extremely nice to me, said to move together. I forgave him.\n\nFast forward 2 weeks later(he was very nice and caring)  I made a joke that I want to eat meat again (we both dont eat meet). He said he wanted to break up, that he had these thoughts about not knowing what we wants again. After 5 min he regreted and wanted to stay together. I left.\n\nNow he tells me to forgive him that he loves me and doesnt know why he behaves like this and he is depressed.\n\n\nOpinions are welcomed:)",

        "Question": "i created a fake account and found out my ex dumped me because i'm black\nI was having one of those nights where i was thinking of him again. I never understood why our relationship didn't work out, I felt there was a real reason that only he knew but didn't want to admit. My looks maybe? My personality, how clingy i got? However i am a terrible overthinker so i dismissed those type of thoughts, the silly thoughts that we have like \"it's because you're black\". Despite feeling left in the dark, i tried my best to make the relationship work, every effort made.\n\nBecause why would he date me in the first place if it was that? Why would we go out, why would he pay for our meals, we'd spend hours talking, have all these intimate moments, just for him to not actually want to pursue anything with me... due to my race?\n\nWell, girls, it is the exact reason. I created a fake account last night and started chatting him up. He confessed everything , to a stranger ! (Me using a fake account meant i was a stranger to him). In his words \"I would've kept dating her if she was white.\" My heart dropped when i read the message. He went on to say \" it's the fact that I'd never want a half black child\" ... I could only marry a white woman\". He's allowed his preferences i believe, but why string me along the whole time..?\n\nAnd so after moments of hurt, i tried healing myself, a little self reflection, trying to keep away flashbacks and tears. A little motivational reading, some looking at myself in the mirror and telling myself \"i am worth it!!\" However i'm starting to think, this is something i should get used to?\n\nI am feeling upset more than angry, i feel like a waste if that makes any sense, i feel stupid. I will never talk to him ever again, for sure. But part of me wants to hire a hitman. \n\nWas i ignorant to think that i could be successful in the dating realm, being the colour that i am? This is the reality for us girls ,right? Or could it be a geographical thing, maybe i'm not looking in the right places. Whatever the conclusion i don't know, i'm wondering if any other girls have been in this situation? Or if you have any advice, support to give? I'd appreciate it. Thanks, have a nice day all!",

It's unlikely that they will actually follow through with their threat to post the nudes online. They are just trying to scare you into giving them money.\r  \n\r  \nCut off all contact with the scammer. Don't respond to any more of their messages, and don't send them any money. If possible, block their phone number and email address.\r  \n\r  \nReport the scam to the police. What the scammer is doing is illegal and considered extortion. Contact your local police department and provide them with any information you have about the scammer.\r  \n\r  \nConsider contacting a lawyer. A lawyer can advise you on your legal options and help you take steps to protect yourself.\r  \n\r  \nSeek support from a trusted friend or family member. It can be helpful to talk to someone you trust about what you're going through and get their support.\r  \n\r  \nTake steps to protect your online accounts.

So I\u2019m guy in my 20s who grew up REALLY religious. As a kid we had a close family friend who I\u2019d spend many nights at his house and he at mine. On a few occasions his older cousin in her teens baby sat us when our parents went out or did events with our church. His cousin was also a member of our church and his family had a lot of prestige within our parish. \n\nWith that as the backdrop, when she would baby sit us she\u2019d let us play and do whatever. But after a while she would call us down to the family computer and porn would be one. She\u2019d have her hand in her pants and call us over. She\u2019d then have me and my friend do things to each other, to her, and she\u2019d do it back to us. It felt good to me but I knew it was wrong, even at 9 years old. She told us not to tell anyone or else our parents would get kicked out of the church. \n\nThis same pattern went on when I was well into my teens until we no longer needed a baby sitter. During puberty this was especially confusing because I didn\u2019t like men but was forced to do sex acts on my friend. Adding to that, i also lost my virginity to her and felt so impure. I didn\u2019t date anyone in HS because of this. I felt undeserving of love and confused about my sexuality. \n\nI experimented plenty when I went off to college and don\u2019t really have ties to the faith anymore. There is still a level of catholic guilt that I don\u2019t know if I\u2019ll ever escape but that\u2019s not all that present in my thoughts these days. The first girl I opened up to about my past left me because I was \u201cwith a man\u201d and I just don\u2019t know that I ever will be willing to be vulnerable like that again. \n\nI guess the reason for this post is to ask if anyone out there has had a similar experience and how you manage? I\u2019ve done therapy in the past but can\u2019t afford it at the moment. \n\nI also want to explore my sexuality further but have a lot of trust issues. Is there a place on Reddit to do so?

        "Question": "Is it irresponsible to hit a dab pen if you\u2019re the only one watching your kid but they\u2019re asleep?\nI thought it might help me relax, so I hit a dab pen that I keep safely put away in a box at the top of my closet where you\u2019re supposed to put hats. I rarely ever use it and it\u2019s been about 6 months since I hit it. Anyway, I wasn\u2019t expecting to get as high as I just got from one hit. Now I\u2019m thinking there\u2019s a small chance my daughter might wake up, and I don\u2019t know if this was an irresponsible move. I have everything around here taken care of, and I\u2019m not struggling to get by or provide, but yet getting high just now has made me question all of that and wonder if I\u2019m even fit to be a parent. \n\nI\u2019m sure I\u2019m just high and it\u2019s actually not that irresponsible, because I\u2019m not impaired or unable to look after her if she wakes up, but I need a little bit of reassurance. My mom called a few minutes after I got high. Everyone always acts so concerned about me, and they always give me advice on what to do and check in on me, because they all think I\u2019m not cut out to be a single parent. None of my family or former in laws trust me at all. That\u2019s the only reason my mom called, and that made me start to wonder if maybe they\u2019re all right about me. I think this was a minor mistake, I didn\u2019t know I was going to get as high as I did, but I don\u2019t think this was irresponsible. Was this pretty bad and a sign that they\u2019re right, or not that big of a deal? If I wasn\u2019t high I would probably be able to know, but I can\u2019t work it out at the moment",

During Xmas, I finally went through his license and saw that his birthday was in 1990 instead of 1998, making him actually 10 years older than me. I felt betrayed seeing this and tried to forgive him. Despite this, I cannot help continue to be reminded of this from time to time and how he basically lied to me for almost a year of our relationship.

But, that feeling of guilt will always be with me, forever. Being told growing up that your parents will have to suffer if their kids are not religious, or following the religion is traumatizing. It sucks and it is so mentally draining.\n\nHow can i ease this feeling of guilt?",

        "Question": "Career Advice\nI have been working for Doordash about a year and a half now. I make $900-$1,000 per week after expenses, tax, gas, and food. I work 7 days a week so that means I don\u2019t have time to spend any of the money I make so that basically means I save $900-$1,000 per week. Last year I bought a 3-plex in my hometown right near main street and moved into one of the apartments. The two other apartments cover my mortgage which basically means I pay no rent. When I\u2019m working, I stay home in between orders and play video games. When I get an order, I pause my game, go deliver the order, then come back home. It\u2019s the best job I ever had, and it\u2019s the most money I\u2019ve ever made. I\u2019m 22, guy, degree in pre-med (dropped out of university), no special experience in any sector of employment, basically a nobody. \n\nBut here\u2019s my quandary, right. My family has a hard time to wrap their heads around my job. Actually, they don\u2019t even consider it a real \u201cjob\u201d. So they offered to pay for my schooling if I went and got a DEP in something. I\u2019m not complaining, it\u2019s very generous of them, so I told them I\u2019d get a DEP in electricity, signed up, got admitted, and now I start my course in about 3 months. The thing is, I keep having second thoughts about it, but I don\u2019t want to pull out because it\u2019s kind of a recurring joke that I never finish what I start and always reverse course last minute. It\u2019s just that I love my job and I\u2019m making good money but at the same time I do agree with them that getting a \u201creal\u201d job (electrician) would be to my benefit.

You said you can \u201cown up to your shit\u201d; this isn\u2019t really you causing a mess of shit in your life, though. You were on birth control (and Plan B), and it failed for whatever reason. It\u2019s an accident. It happens because that\u2019s generally what happens when people have sex; someone gets pregnant. \n\nAsk yourself: do you WANT to have a baby now? Fuck whatever sperm-donor over there says - especially the part about \u201cWE should get an abortion\u201d. HE faces no physical consequences of his ejaculation. YOU do, and if you choose to go that route, YOU will be having the abortion, not him. It\u2019s easy for him to go to this conclusion quickly because he\u2019s not the one facing the consequences of such a decision, you are. \n\nSo, circle back around: DO YOU WANT TO HAVE A BABY? You said you are financially able to support having a baby. You said you\u2019d have him sign away his rights (which does not mean he won\u2019t be paying child support, by the way; he\u2019s still financially on the hook for this), and handle things on your own. Ok, so you have the rest of the boxes checked, but do you WANT a baby? That\u2019s entirely up to you, and you\u2019ll get no judgement from me (pro-choice here, for the record).\n\nMy advice: take some time to really reflect on if you are really ready for a baby. See the doctor, and gather your inner circle for support. In most places, you have up to 24 weeks pregnant to obtain an abortion. \n\nGood luck to you.",

        "Question": "My (33m) girlfriend (29f) isn\u2019t paying rent. Should I break up?\nI (33m) have been together with my gf (29f) for nearly 4 years now. She comes from a wealthy family. Well, her extended family is wealthy. Her parents are somewhere in the low 7 figures. But she never had to worry about money. Therefore she never really had a job. Sometimes she would work for her dad\u2019s company. But that would only be minor tasks. I never really worried about that because it was made clear she would take over the business and thought she\u2019d get everything together by then. At one point I got a bit annoyed that she was always at home and got her a job through a friend of mine where she works a few hours per week. \n\nI kind of became suspicious when she didn\u2019t finish her degree and confronted her about it. But she shrugged it off and told me it wasn\u2019t any of my business as long as she was able to pay rent and contribute financially to our life. Since communication is very important to me I was a bit alarmed. \n\nDuring the last year things got rocky. For reference: We split rent and costs for our dog 50/50. Since I\u2019m using her car sometimes I give her half of the leasing rate + gas. Other spendings are all from our own accounts.\n\nLast summer we went on a roadtrip where I payed for everything. Afterwards I told her the total, expecting her to pay me back. She told me she couldn\u2019t afford it, which I thought was weird. First of all because I know she got a huuuuge cheque from her dad the year before and I thought it was a bit unfair not to clarify beforehand. Since then she only payed rent sporadically. When I confronted her about it and asked her when she was gonna contribute again to our shared life I barely got an answer or she told me she couldn\u2019t afford it. \n\nTo be clear, it\u2019s not about the money but more about the way of not communicating about this issue. Am I expecting too much? How could I address this better? Or is this a major red flag?",

I didn\u2019t have any plant based milk in the house so they brought a container with a little bit of oat milk in it so they could have a cup of tea here. They accidentally left that container and the milk went bad so I threw it away and washed the container.\nWe were chatting about oat milk and they mentioned how expensive it is. I know that it\u2019s fairly easy to make your own and was wondering if it would be weird if I gave them their container back with some homemade oat milk in it? Or is that too odd? I\u2019m like 80% sure they would appreciate it but the 20% is shouting loudly that it\u2019s too weird so I\u2019d love some opinions please!",

I\u2019m supposed to put myself in jeopardy to go to jail so that my sister can walk free. But why doesn\u2019t my family try to keep me out of that situation? Why would my family feel comfortable putting me in jail when I\u2019ve never did anything to have any run in with the police? I\u2019m told that I have a bad view of family and I should do better.

People often talk about depression in relation to a lack of interest in activities and this is the part exactly that I believe causes it. \n\nIf this sounds like her she needs to work on being present during activities and not in her head. Activities are never fun if you're in your head worrying over how you appear or contemplating what you'll do for the rest of your day. I made this mistake my entire life. The only thing that I could do to be present during an activity was play video games or read. I never considered why I liked those things I was just grateful I did like them and found relief when doing them. Now I understand it's because I gave them my undivided attention. Since focusing on that and putting forth the effort in other activities my interests have become endless.",

It has a significant impact on our relationships with others but also ourselves. Most people don\u2019t realize it, but it rewires our brains to make us more lethargic and decreases our social capacity. I\u2019m not surprised it\u2019s an issue for you too.  \nThe way I fixed it was with this app [Present](https://apps.apple.com/app/apple-store/id1644737181?pt=125390894&ct=redditrelationshipadvice&mt=8) that turned staying off your phone into a game. You earn points, awards, and streaks + you can challenge others.  \nI went to my significant other with the app and said it could be a fun game we could play together to both be more \u201cpresent\u201d in our life. Next thing I knew they were motivating themselves to reduce their screen time and our relationship was basically back to normal within a few weeks.   \nThe key was I didn\u2019t try to say \u201cyou need to stay off your phone more\u201d or force them to install an app blocker (which don\u2019t even work anyways). This way we were able to turn it into a game we could play TOGETHER.",

The things you\u2019re attracted to with develop and change as you explore your way through life more. I understand this probably doesn\u2019t exactly help you right this second.
